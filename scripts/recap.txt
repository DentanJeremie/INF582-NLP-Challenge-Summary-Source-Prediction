We 've enjoyed some of the highest temperatures of the year this week . The range starts at Â£ 31,995 and the Audi can cost as much as Â£ 50,000 . No matter how good , the new Audi TT still has nothing on the 1999 model . With the sunshine beaming this week and some of the highest temperatures recorded so far this year , what better moment to splash out on the new third-generation Audi TT Roadster . It goes on sale this month . Just the time to get the roof off on this softtop German sports car , which has established itself as a firm favourite in the 16 years it has been on the road . I drove the fully stocked four-wheel-drive 2-litre TFSI in S-line quattro trim with 230 bhp , which was adept at whipping around the Cotswolds in style . Sure-footed and fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 seconds up to a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph . CO2 emissions are a fair 154g/km . Supportively cossetting sports seats leave you sitting comfortably at the wheel . A nicely tuned exhaust pipe gives the TT Roadster a most satisfying ` brrrm brrrm ' . You wo n't break the bank at the filling station . Even with the satisfying performance you 'll average 43.5 mpg , rising to 52.3 mpg when cruising and still managing a respectable 33.6 mpg around town .

Auto-dim LED headlights have been transferred across from the flagship Audi A8 saloon . If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . Though this version is on an allnew platform , the progression is evolution , not revolution . The car I drove cost well in excess of Â£ 50,000 . The range starts from Â£ 31,995 for the 2-litre TDi Sport in six-speed manual . The optional open-top driving package includes head-level heating to keep your bonce from getting chilly , an electrically operated wind deflector , which stops parky draughts whistling behind your neck , and handily heated super sports seats . No matter how good , nothing will have the jaw-dropping impact on the car market as the original Audi TT of 1999 . It was dubbed the ` Bauhaus Bullet ' because of its clean , minimalist lines reminiscent of the German art movement of the Twenties and early Thirties . Hefty prestige price tag . The base price of the car I drove was Â£ 41,630 . But it was loaded up with extras adding another Â£ 13,000 -- or the price of a half-decent family runaround . These include an open-top driving package -LRB- Â£ 1,000 -RRB- , rotorgrey fine Nappa leather and super-sports seats -LRB- Â£ 1,390 -RRB- , a comfort and sound package -LRB- Â£ 1,590 -RRB- , technology package -LRB- Â£ 1,795 -RRB- , electric front seats -LRB- Â£ 995 -RRB- , 19 in twin-spoke alloy wheels -LRB- Â£ 450 -RRB- , metallic paint -LRB- Â£ 545 -RRB- , and LED headlights -LRB- Â£ 945 -RRB- .
