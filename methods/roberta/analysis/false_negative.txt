Societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in an all-powerful deity, according to new research. 

The study uncovered a link between belief in God and other societal characteristics, such as a strong social hierarchy.

Scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats.

‘When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,’ said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland and a founding director of the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences in Jena, Germany.

‘Prosocial behaviour [actions that help others] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments.’

Together with other experts, he found that communities that believe in a high, controlling God or gods who enforce a moral code, tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals.

While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre (Nescent) in Durham, North Carolina, implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors.

‘When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,’ said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland. Here, devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the Hindu sun god as they attend Pongal celebrations, at a slum in Mumbai

The UK is one of the least religious places in the world, according to a new survey.

In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious.

This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are ‘convinced atheists’, with the remaining Britons saying they ‘did not know’.

In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five, with 93 per cent each.

At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious.

It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent.

Globally two-thirds of people consider themselves religious.

Those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found.

People without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith.

‘When researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history, there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment," said primary author Carlos Botero, of North Carolina State University.

‘We wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today.’

The study, published in PNAS, took into account variables associated with the environment, history, and culture and involved experts in biology, ecology, linguistics, anthropology, and theology.

It began when evolutionary ecologist Dr Botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising, high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds.

He took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion, and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation.

Professor Gray said: ‘Although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive, the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically, we get some insight.’ 

While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study  implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. Here, Muslims on the outskirts of New Delhi participate in Friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of Ramadan

The team used historical, social, and ecological data, such as plant growth, rain and temperature, for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising, high gods and external variables.

They used the Ethograhic Atlas, which was collated during the last century, to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs, agriculture, and animal husbandry.

‘The goal became not just to look at the ecological variables, but to look at the whole thing. 

'Once we accounted for as many other factors as we could, we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect,’ Dr Botero said.

‘The overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical, ecological, and social factors.’

Dr Botero believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint.

The team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos, circumcision, and the modification of natural habitats. 

Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as The Scrooge Effect, after the Dickens character (shown)

Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous, according to a new study.

It also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed.

‘Acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety, and in turn produces psychological satisfaction,’ researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.

The study builds on the terror management theory, which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on, Pacific Standard reported.

Previous work found that Americans reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country, than one that had an international focus.

It suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country – and is known as The Scrooge Effect.

The new study included an experiment, where people were asked to split $8 between themselves and a stranger, while reporting their own satisfaction.

Before this, Polish student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death, or dealing with a trip to the dentists, then complete a crossword.

The researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it.

The experiment seems to bolster The Scrooge Effect and suggests that reinforcing a person’s self-image of being generous, or supporting a cause, are effective ways of managing fear of dying.

Five-star Ballyfin has was given the prestigious award in the publication 's latest edition . The high-profile couple stayed there last May on their honeymoon following their Italian nuptials . The entirety of the elegant hotel can be hired out for £ 18,000 -LRB- € 25,000 -RRB- a night .
-----------------------------------------------
It seemed a somewhat unusual honeymoon destination for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

But the couple insist they fell in love with the 'calm' of Ireland on a previous visit and just had to return. Of course, they did it in style, staying at the 18th-century Ballyfin, at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains in the centre of the country.

And now the five-star hotel has been given the highest accolade, declared the grandest hotel in Ireland by Conde Nast Traveller magazine.  

Splendour! Ballyfin has been named by travel publication Condé Nast Traveller as the grandest hotel in Ireland

The five-star retreat boasts a luxurious pool, which can be enjoyed with privacy due to its small volume of rooms 

Grand retreat! With only 20 rooms for the 614 acre estate, this 5 star luxury hotel is the perfect place for a break from the stresses of the modern world and provides discretion and privacy like few other destinations

Set at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the five-star Ballyfin played host to the famous couple last May 

The high profile couple were seen travelled by Mercedes to the hotel during their first holiday as a married couple, last year.

The famous couple headed to the picturesque Co Laois area, following tying the knot in an opulent Italian wedding ceremony last May 24.

Many were baffled at them shunning popular exotic holiday destinations such as the Seychelles and Maldives but Kim tweeted her explanation. 

'We spent Kanye's bday in Ireland a few years back & fell in love with it! Its such a calming relaxing place!'

The couple enjoyed a relaxing stay at the hotel, which has only 20 rooms on its 614 acre estate

Set at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the entirety of the elegant Ballyfin can be hired out for a small €25,000 (£18,000) a night. 

It prides itself on promoting a break from the stresses of modern life, and maintaining privacy for guests. 

With only 20 rooms on the 614 acre estate, it aims to be a relaxing haven for its guests.

During their Irish stay, the couple headed to the local cinema, to the surprise of locals, and enjoyed the outdoors with a mountain biking trek.  

Intimate luxury! The elegant manor house has snug rooms restored to their 18th century glory 

The interior decoration of the hotel is renown for being one of the finest examples of the Neoclassical and Empire periods in Ireland.

Guests can take their pick of luxurious places to relaxing, from the eighty-foot library and Gold Drawing Room, to the grand saloon.

Hidden away behind a secret bookcase in the library is even a sun-filled conservatory. 

The rooms are bedecked with Irish art and antiques from around the world, aiming to preserve the elegance from Ballyfin's 1820s beginning. 

The house has long been admired  in Ireland, and after eight years of restoration, Ballyfin re-opened in May 2011 as a 5 star country house hotel

Last year Tourism Minister Paschal Donohoe revealed that visitors to Ireland from Great Britain increased by 11.3 per cent, with an extra 178,200 visitors on 2013. 

Visits from Kim and Kayne, combined with the filming of Game of Thrones, helped to boost these numbers dramatically.

Ballyfin remained discreet on the impact of the couple's stay on its own popularity. 

A spokesperson for the hotel said: 'The privacy Ballyfin affords is one of many compelling reasons that guests will choose to stay at the hotel. 

'Ballyfin respects this at all times and would never compromise this stance.'

Enjoy the stunning hotel, or take advantage of the picturesque outside gardens and areas

Opulent! Condé Nast Traveller has dubbed the five-star 18th century manor hotel as the grandest hotel in the country

Unusual honeymoon! Kim and Kanye were seen heading to the cinema twice during their first holiday as a couple

Guests can enjoy the immaculate rooms inside the 1820s house which can be hired out for £18,000 (€25,000) a night

Tourists and locals queue for several hours to get their hands on Jenny 's butter cookies . People are even hired to stand in line to buy the cookies , which are later sold at an up-to-70 % mark-up . Food frenzies have also taken place in other parts of the world .
-----------------------------------------------
Hong Kong (CNN)There's a booming black market in Hong Kong, but it's not for fake Apple Watches, or the iPhone.

Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies.

Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin.

Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies.

The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the "little bear cookies" as they are known across Asia.

People are even hired to stand in line to buy the goods and are later resold at a 70% mark-up yards away, something the bakery also tries to discourage.

A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. But when they see cameras approaching, they scurry away, only to reappear on another street corner.

The frenzy in Hong Kong over the buttery treats is by no means an isolated example.

In other parts of the world, food mania has erupted, swiftly winning people's hearts and stomachs, only to fizzle out in a few months.

From cronuts to ramen burgers, here are some foods that people around the world have spent hours of their lives waiting for. Were they worth it?

Spieth set a new Masters scoring record with a 14-under 130 through two rounds at Augusta National . This was Spieth 's sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par . The next Tiger ? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders .
-----------------------------------------------
Momentarily, he looked his age. Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green.

History was assured. He wasn’t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters.

He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn’t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. 

Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130

Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history

Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn’t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn’t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods’s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole.

If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall.

Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth’s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before — but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too.

‘I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,’ Spieth confirmed. ‘I was going to have to work around Henrik’s line — and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss.

‘I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it’s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to set a record is awesome.’

Spieth broke Raymond Floyd's 36-hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes

At the age of 21 and playing in his second Masters, Spieth looks in complete control 

Billy Horschel, Spieth’s playing partner, had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day. Horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message ‘Nice hole, Jordan’ as they stood on every tee. Nothing changed overnight. Many had Augusta pegged as the venue where Rory McIlroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015; instead, this Masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young Texan gunslinger, now in the vanguard of an American revival.

Up ahead of Spieth, Ernie Els laboured valiantly to stay in touch. It was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career. At the age of 25, as McIlroy is now, Els won his first major, the 1994 US Open. He was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade, and he won it again in 1997. By that time, however, a 21-year-old called Tiger Woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 Masters. The era of Els never materialised.

McIlroy may have achieved more and younger than Els, and Spieth may not be the ice-cold winning machine Woods was at his age — but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days. Already in the record books, Spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days. The record for birdies here stands at 25 from Phil Mickelson; Spieth already has 15.

His course management was outstanding. Spieth took Augusta on, yet remained entirely in control. It helps that he is exceptional, yet strangely unspectacular. As Graeme McDowell pointed out recently there are better drivers, better chippers, better putters — and the statistics bear this out — but none who do all three as well as Spieth. He might not have the best game; but he has the most complete.

There were tiny aberrations — he found the pine straw twice on the back nine — but they were rare. Most of the time, he was consistency personified, picking out the best line, the best lie, the most advantageous position on the green. When he dallied with a bunker on the par-five eighth, his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two-foot putt for birdie.

Spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the Augusta fairways and greens

The young Texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round

‘That was special, even for you,’ said Horschel’s caddie Micah Fugitt. It was a masterful display, the work of a wise head not a callow college boy. It isn’t just that Spieth doesn’t think like a 21-year-old. At the 15th, a par five and a good birdie opportunity, he sensibly laid up, and then made four. Even when he missed, he missed cute.

He has absorbed a lot from his mentor Ben Crenshaw, a fellow Texan and Augusta expert. Asked about ‘Ben’s advice’ on Thursday, Spieth sweetly replied: ‘Do you mean Mr Crenshaw?’ There wasn’t a hint of irony in his response.

Had he stayed in school, he would be studying for his finals right now. Instead he is fast approaching £10m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major. The next Tiger? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders. The idea that McIlroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked. When Spieth shot 63 to win the Australian Open at Royal Sydney, the conditions were windy and inhospitable. McIlroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made Spieth’s score. Geoff Ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in Australia.

Where do Spieth’s first 36 holes stand in the annals at Augusta? Ray Floyd played the previous best 36 holes — 13 under par — in 1976. Spieth now has that record, as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18-hole lead. Like McIlroy’s US Open victory at Congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books. He has barely put a foot wrong. Nice hole, Jordan? Seriously, dude, name one that wasn’t.

Spieth recovers from among the trees at 13, and his caddie Michael Greller has to hand it to him (below)

Michael Owen said Newcastle would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play in the Premier League . John Carver 's Newcastle side have lost their last six straight league games . Phil Neville and Sportsmail 's Jamie Carragher have also criticised the club . Carver believes such pundits do not know the ins and outs of management .
-----------------------------------------------
John Carver has hit back at former Newcastle captain Michael Owen after he said they would lose every remaining match this season.

The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five.

The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea.

Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side

Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe 

Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009

Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone

Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley.

But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009.

‘I could be nasty about Michael because let’s not forget what happened when he was here,’ said Carver.

‘But listen, I don’t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now.

‘They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, "Where’s that come from?”.’ 

He added: ‘Let’s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven’t. I understand that.

‘But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different.

‘There are a lot of people out there who don’t do it because they can’t do it.

‘It’s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don’t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don’t see that.’ 

Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively.

‘I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,’ said United’s head coach.

‘And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.’ 

Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea

Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The £6million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game.

But Carver said: ‘You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, “What a player he is”.

‘If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.’

Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon

At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs

Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having £34million in the bank

It was posted to Twitter on Sunday by an anti-Islamic State activist in Syria . It is believed to be the latest chapter in the group 's propaganda campaign . It follows a series of shocking posts of young boys being radicalised . The terror group grooms children to take part in jihad from a young age .
-----------------------------------------------
A sickening propaganda image linked to the Islamic State terrorist group has surfaced showing a newborn baby sleeping next to a grenade, a handgun and what appears to be a birth certificate.

The image, which has not been verified,  was re-posted to Twitter on Sunday by an anti-ISIS activist in Syria with the warning:  'This child will be risk to you not just to us'.

Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi, a self proclaimed 'founder of the Syrian revolution,' believes the chilling image was released to radicalise the next generation of jihadis.

Terror experts have revealed to Daily Mail Australia the snapshot is a showcase of the groups supposed longevity, as well as a compelling window into life within their self-declared caliphate.

The sickening image of a newborn baby pictured next to a handgun, grenade and Islamic State birth certificate 

The post says the newborn child is called ‘Jrah’, while its mothers name is ‘Om’ and its fathers name is ‘Abu.’

It also claims the certificate next to the baby is an 'ISIS issued ID for a child.'

The image was believed to be posted by Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi in the hope of garnering attention to the international threat posed by ISIS.

The image has yet to be verified but it bears strong similarities to earlier ISIS propaganda. 

Last September, a harrowing image was released by the group of a baby dressed as a fighter lying on an Islamic state flag beside grenades and enormous automatic firearms.

In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted a Twitter image of his seven-year-old son gripping the severed head of a Syrian soldier, with the accompanying caption 'that's my boy!'

The chilling snapshot was re-posted by anti-Islamic State activists in hopes of garnering international attention to the threat posed by the depraved militant group

The image bears a strong resemblance to earlier ISIS propaganda, such as this image of a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons

Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones told Daily Mail Australia the image appears to be authentic.

‘By showing the birth certificate, and the fact that the group are indoctrinating babies, I think ISIS are indicating they will be around for a long time.’

‘It’s an interesting signal of life within the caliphate. Obviously by posting opposition to the Islamic State from within their borders the activist is operating with great risk.’

Jones said the post could be an international plea for military intervention on account of the rapid deterioration of life in Raqqa, the stronghold of the Islamic State. 

In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf released this image of his seven-year-old son  holding a severed head

ISIS has made it a policy to groom children to take part in jihad, brainwashing them from a very young age.

Online propaganda is an integral part of this process, with the group using scores of social media accounts to disseminate their messages to youths around the world.

In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda in Australia.

The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of extremist propaganda.

The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages.

Alfred Hitchcock was born in 1899 in Leytonstone , East London . He later became ` one of the most distinguished directors in the world . But his insecurities began to seep into his cinematography . Actress Tippi Hedren once said ` he was almost obsessed with me '
-----------------------------------------------
ALFRED HITCHCOCK

by Peter Ackroyd

(Chatto & Windus £12.99

With this nutritious, compact and superb critical biography, Ackroyd emphasises the importance of Victorian and Edwardian London in the imagination of Alfred Hitchcock — the ‘damp-looking dirty blackness’ of the East End; the ‘manifold ruffianism’ of the Cockneys; the pubs, street markets, theatres and music halls, with their ‘variety acts, dioramas and Italian operettas’.

Alfred Hitchcock (pictured) was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London

In addition to the gaudiness, the city was a place with dark staircases, gaslight, rain and spooky cobbled alleys: the ideal setting for murder.

Hitchcock was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London, the son of a wholesale grocer. They were a Catholic family, Irish originally, and the boy who would become ‘one of the most distinguished directors in the world’ was educated by the Jesuits.

The bullying Christian Brothers may have taught ‘the virtues of order, control and precision’, but they also instilled (with the strap) a belief in mystery and miracles.

The logic and reason, coupled with a mood of anxiety, dread and paranoid suspicion, seeped into Hitchcock’s work: ‘He thought everyone was doing something physical and nasty behind every closed door’. Looking back on his schooldays, he said that, as the Jesuits had frightened him, ‘now I’m getting my own back by terrifying other people’.

Hitchcock was never any oil painting. A 5 ft 7 in Humpty Dumpty, he was the neurotic fat boy with piggy eyes, who was filled with ‘lavish and peculiar’ repressed sexual fantasies.

His entire oeuvre, Ackroyd suggests, was a study of voyeurism, violence and guilt with, on the one hand, the rape and murder of vulnerable women, and, on the other, the pursuit of a hero accused of crimes he did not commit.

His very first work, in 1927, The Lodger, was about a man wrongly accused of being Jack The Ripper and, already, Hitchcock could whip up an atmosphere of ‘doubt and suspense’, the camera dwelling on ‘dark puddles shimmering with opalescent light’.

His opening in movies began at the studios in Islington and Twickenham, where Hitchcock created the captions for silent movies and designed the title cards. Here, he met Alma Reville, whom he married in 1926. Alma was an editor who ‘emphasised the importance of smooth continuity and the subtle use of close-up’.

She was thin and boyish, wearing trouser-suits tailored at Austin Reed, ‘the gentlemen’s outfitters’. The Hitchcocks lived at 153 Cromwell Road and had one daughter, Patricia. Apart from conceiving Patricia, Ackroyd assures us, Hitchcock and Alma never had sex together again. Ackroyd goes into raptures about The Lodger, which starred Ivor Novello. ‘The use of light was its music, rising in intensity, in the process creating a unique rhythm of meaning’. Would Hitchcock have seen it this way?

The shower scene from Hitchcock's Psycho (Janet Leigh pictured playing Marion Crane in the film) is one of the most recognisable shots in cinematic history

When he wrote his granddaughter’s film studies essay for her, he (or she) was awarded a C. ‘Well, I’m sorry. That’s the best I can do,’ he said, grumpily. But it never does to ask an artist to explain his own flavour and texture — it makes for self-consciousness.

Such was Hitchcock’s critical and popular success that, by the early Thirties, he was earning £13,000 a year — £700,000 in today’s money. His skill was to merge larger-than-life melodramas — bombs, assassins, enemy agents — with mundane tasks and anxieties, about catching trains, losing a tie-pin, or (notoriously) taking a shower.

He moved to Hollywood in 1939, to make Rebecca with Laurence Olivier. The Hitchcocks bought a house in Bel Air and an 85-acre ranch in Santa Cruz.

The brightness of California’s blue pools and red clay tennis courts was in marked contrast to London’s charcoal murk yet, as in his English films, Hitchcock found that, in the sunshine, ‘fear became an intrinsic aspect of daily life’.

Cary Grant, Gregory Peck and James Stewart were now his wrongly accused leading men. Kim Novak, Tippi Hedren and Grace Kelly were his ‘ideal blonde beauties’, the women alone, menaced by intruders.

Princess Grace, in particular, was described by Hitchcock as ‘a volcano covered with snow’ — with the implication that these ice maidens rather liked being plunged into dangerous situations, because it aroused them.

He was respected, but not liked. With the stars, Hitchcock was awkward, even contemptuous, calling them ‘cattle’. Marlene Dietrich called him ‘a strange little man. I didn’t like him’, and Hitchcock had an unfortunate fondness for cruel practical jokes — plying people with drinks laced with laxatives, handcuffing people and losing the key. He also ‘had a schoolboy’s obsession with sex that went on and on in a very peculiar way’, the dirty jokes accompanied by salacious groping.

Hitchcock (pictured with his two granddaughters) was respected in the industry, but not liked. Marlene Dietrich called him ‘a strange little man. I didn’t like him’

Then there’s Hitchcock’s clammy behaviour towards Tippi Hedren during the making of The Birds and Marnie — ‘he was almost obsessed with me,’ says the actress, ‘and it’s very difficult to be the object of someone’s obsession’. Ackroyd valiantly tries to defend the director’s control freakery by arguing that Hitchcock was doing nothing worse than deliberately trying to elicit a nervous and terrified performance for the cameras.’

Through provocation and bullying, says Ackroyd, Hitchcock was being professional. It was a strategy. Hmm.

I think I prefer Francois Truffaut’s observation that ‘Hitchcock filmed scenes of murder as if they were love scenes, and scenes of love as if they were scenes of murder’.

The camera always lingers on faces that could be wracked with either pain or pleasure. (‘When he sticks it in her,’ he gleefully instructed his cinematographer prior to shooting a rape sequence, ‘I want the camera right on her face!’) Victims swoon. Hands grasp a neck — strangulation is an embrace, for example, in Strangers On A Train or the shocking despatch of Anna Massey in Frenzy.

Everybody remembers Psycho, with Anthony Perkins as the ‘excitable and sexually ambiguous’ Norman Bates — a thin version of Hitchcock himself, it seems.

In the shower scene, ‘chocolate syrup was used for the blood’. A smashing detail I hadn’t known before. The audiences screamed to such an extent, Hitchcock pocketed a profit of $15 million.

In The Birds, gulls and crows were flung at Tippi Hedren in an attic set for five days solid, scratching her to pieces. Live birds were tied to her body with elastic bands, so that they’d bounce about and flap and perch on her face. ‘The actual biting is done by glove puppets,’ Ackroyd maintains. But a lot of those pecks look genuine — Hitchcock’s revenge, it is said, because Hedren had rejected his advances.

Hitchcock died in 1980 from ailments related to obesity and alcoholism: colitis, arthritis, gall stones, renal failure. He’d done more than anyone since Edgar Allan Poe to make our flesh creep. As usual, the Honours Committee made a fool of itself, only getting around to making him Sir Alfred on his deathbed.

Alastair Clarkson has been filmed pushing and grabbing the neck of an Adelaide Power fan after Hawthorn 's loss to Port Adelaide on Saturday . The intoxicated fan is seen harassing Clarkson outside his Adelaide hotel . Clarkson was ` pushed , shoved all the way to the door , ' Hawks CEO says .
-----------------------------------------------
Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson has been filmed lashing out at an aggressive AFL fan after his team's narrow loss to Port Adelaide on Saturday night.

The footage shows a young man, thought to be an Adelaide Power fan, taunting Clarkson as he made his way back to his Adelaide hotel room, before Clarkson pushes the man and grabs his neck.

It appears the video was captured by a friend of the young man and it's understood the pair had been goading Clarkson in the lead-up to the confrontation.

Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson was filmed lashing out at a young man, thought to be an Adelaide Power fan after his team's loss on the weekend

Alastair Clarkson was approached by the fan as he made his way back to his Adelaide hotel room. The man reportedly 'got in his face' yelling 'Hey Clarko, how was the win today brother?'

In the video, which was provided to Channel Seven, the fan is seen shouting in the face of the Hawks coach. 

'Hey Clarko, Clarko, how was the win, how was the win today brother? Goooo the Power! 

An agitated Clarkson lashes out at the man before grabbing him by the throat. 

The incident took place in the hours after the Hawthorn Hawks' narrow eight-point loss to Port Adelaide.  

Hawthorn CEO Stuart Fox, who saw the incident unfold, has described it as 'very unfortunate.'

'Alastair was walking back to the hotel with our general manager of football Chris Fagan and came across some intoxicated boys and Clarko was certainly harassed,' Fox said in an interview with Fox Sports. 

'He politely declined to be photographed and videoed and the boys just got in his face and tried to get Clarko into the hotel and it was one of those issues that got a little bit ugly. 

It's not known whether the man in the video was a Power supporter as he wasn't wearing any Port Adelaide clothing.   

Port Adelaide CEO Keith Thomas said those responsible would be held accountable if found to be club members.

'If it is a Port Adelaide member … we'll be acting pretty aggressively about that,' Thomas told Fox Sports.

Hawks coach Alastair Clarkson, pictured, was 'pushed and shoved all the way to the door,' says Hawthorn CEO

It's not the first altercation the Hawthorn coach has been involved in. In 2006 Clarkson was fined $5000 for abusing umpires on board a plane and in 2008 he was fined for criticising umpire Justin Schmitt’s performance which involved a defeat to Geelong.

But Hawthorn's Stuart Fox and others in the AFL community have voiced their support of Clarkson, saying he was 'harassed.' 

Fox said the video missed the minute prior to the incident where Clarkson and Chris Fagan declined photographs with the two fans and tried to get themselves to the hotel room.

'They were pushed and shoved all the way up to the door and, unfortunately, Clarko's pushed back and got himself in the hotel and gone straight to bed' Fox said. 

Fox said the incident draws attention to the lack of security at the hotel. He said the club has contacted the AFL to seek clarification on post-game security procedures.

In 2006, Clarkson was fined $5000 for abusing umpires on a flight and in 2008 he was fined for criticising umpire's performance over a defeat to Geelong

Hawthorn CEO Stuart Fox told media the boys were intoxicated and 'Clarko was certainly harassed'

Port Adelaide fans celebrate their eight-point wine over Hawthorn at Adelaide Oval on Saturday

The hotel altercation took place a few hours after the round 4 AFL match between Hawthorn and Port Adelaide on Saturday

Former Collingwood and Brisbane coach Leigh Matthews has also come out in support of Clarkson, Fairfax reports.  

'He's shoved the guy away. It was unbelievable provocation, really. The guy was lucky he didn't get knocked into next week,' Matthews told Channel Seven. 

Hawkes CEO Stuart Fox said Clarkson would be busy and 'pretty focused' today on the team's Box Hill game in Victoria.

Former model Jennifer Sky , 38 , claims that models are being asked to stuff their underwear with sandbags so they can clock in at a ` healthy ' weight . The activist says she is against France 's new law , which bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low .
-----------------------------------------------
Europe's controversial new laws banning ultra-thin models from strutting down the catwalk may be doing more harm than good as models are reportedly going to extreme measures to ensure they clock in at a 'healthy' weight when they hop on the scale - including stuffing their underwear with sandbags.

Earlier this month France passed a new law that bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low, in an attempt to combat anorexia. And the pressure is on for agencies who can face a fines of up to $80,000 and six months in prison for employing too-thin models.

But former model Jennifer Sky, 38, from Brooklyn, New York, has revealed in an op-ed for the New York Observer that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations, explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted Spanx in order to cheat the new BMI standards. 

New kind of pressure: Former model Jennifer Sky, pictured in 2013 (R) and 2003 (L), has reported that models are being asked to wear Spanx underwear stuffed with sandbags, so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight 

Different rules: Models can be seen walking down the runway at the Masha Ma show in March at Paris Fashion Week. France recently passed a law banning models from the catwalk if their body mass index is too low

An anonymous model, referred to in the piece as 'Lauren', told Jennifer that she participated in Spanish Fashion Week, sometime after the country passed its new weight law in 2006 and recalled being asked to hide weights in her undergarments. 

'They gave us Spanx underwear to stuff with weighted sandbags so the thinnest of girls had a "healthy" weight on the scales,' Lauren said. 'I even saw them put weights in their hair.'

Jennifer went on to say that she hopes the US does not try to pass this 'discriminatory and misguided' because of its negative affect on naturally thin women. 

She noted that when she was a teenager she too would have been deemed underweight because BMI calculations, which are based on weight and height, don't take age, sex or genetic body shape into account.  

'At 16, when I was working as a fashion model, I weighed 115 pounds and was 5’7” 1/2,' she wrote. 'I exercised regularly and really loved to eat Subway veggie sandwiches and drink McDonald’s vanilla milkshakes.'

Major changes: Models can be seen strutting down the catwalk during the YDE show at Paris Fashion Week in March. Agencies who employ 'too-thin' models face large fines and even jail time under the new French law

She continued: 'I was not anorexic or starving - I was definitely over-worked. I was simply a naturally thin teenager with a powerful teenage metabolic system.'

Jennifer noted that as a teen with a BMI of 18.0, she would most certainly have been considered 'underweight'; while the exact BMI requirements for models working in France have not been released, the World Health Organization considers people with a BMI below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished.

And while Jennifer says that, 22 years later her current measurements finally put her at a 'normal' 21.0, her BMI for most of her modeling career would have been deemed too dangerous for her to work under the new laws.

While the model rights activist applauded the French government for attempting to protect the health of 'these young working professionals', she and Lauren both agreed that outlawing skinny altogether is not the answer.

'I think a better solution is to raise the age limit for models to 18,' Lauren told Jennifer. 'Many ultra-thin models are simply still going through puberty, and allowing their bodies to form before their career would be beneficial to all.' 

Model rights activist: Jennifer spoke with Megan Alexander (R) about trafficking, abuse, and child labor problems within the fashion industry on Inside Edition in February 

Strict rules: The 38-year-old, who snapped this 'Post Fashion Week' selfie in February, noted her BMI would have been considered too low when she was a healthy 16-year-old model because she had a fast metabolism 

Jennifer added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models, the French government should 'look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client-models as working professionals'.

Because models are considered independent contractors in the US, standard employment laws, which allow workers mandatory breaks, compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment, do not apply. 

Sara Ziff, who is a model and founder of The Model Alliance organization, told Think Progress in March that she is also against the new French law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a 'healthy ideal'. 

'BMI suggests there are distinct categories of underweight, ideal, overweight and obese, with sharp boundaries that hinge on a decimal place, which is simply not true,' she explained. 'It is unfair and unreasonable to ban healthy models from working just because they have a relatively low BMI.'

-----------------------------------------------
Fourteen people were hospitalized after the entire roof of a New Jersey church came crashing down mid-song during an afternoon Easter Sunday service.

Around 75 people were inside the Korean Union United Methodist Church in Rahway when the ceiling collapsed, fire department battalion chief Daryl Rutter told Daily Mail Online. 

Thirteen people had minor injuries while one woman was sent to the trauma center at University Hospital with a serious but non-life threatening head injury.

Rutter said churchgoers suffered face and head injuries, as well as cuts, bruises and abrasions. 

He said the scene was 'chaotic' when the fire department arrived at the church. Thirty-five people were standing outside and some were crying. 

The parishioners were from the Manantial de Vida Pentecostal congregation, which rents out the church space.

A witness told CBS New York that they were in the middle of a song around 2pm when they heard a cracking sound from above.

Suddenly, debris began to rain down on the churchgoers. The witness said people screamed as they ran for cover.

The cause of the collapse is currently being investigated. Rutter told the Daily Mail Online that no one will be allowed back into the building until an engineering firm is able to check its stability. 

Rutter said the scene wasn't cleared until near 5pm, as churchgoers hung around to check on their friends and the status of the church.

Rahway Police Chief John Rodger told CBS New York it was a miracle no one was more severely injured.

'Nobody was killed,' he said. 

'So, maybe being on Easter Sunday, we got a little help from God on this one.'

9 in 10 teens go online every day , unable to resist the lure of Facebook . Parents also face a nightmare monitoring children as 71 % of teens use more than one social network , the Pew Research Centre found . Nearly three-quarters of teens have or have access to a smartphone .
-----------------------------------------------
Nearly one in four teenagers are ‘almost constantly’ online as their lives are swallowed up ever more by their mobile phones, a study has revealed.

Some 24 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds admitted they were continuously checking their devices, including when they were at school.

Nine in teenagers also confessed to going online every day as they were unable to resist the lure of Facebook and Instagram.

In danger? The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where messages disappears seconds after they are sent

Parents now find it increasingly difficult to monitor their children's online behaviour as more than 70 per cent of teens use now more than one social network.

The study was carried out on American teenagers but the findings would likely be worse in the UK as more British teenagers own smartphones than their US counterparts.

The Pew Research Centre asked 1,060 children aged between 13 and 17 about their phone habits.

The report found that what Pew described as a  ‘frenzy of access’ was facilitated by mobile phones - particularly smartphones.

Of the 92 per cent of teens who went online every day, more than half said that meant using their phones several times a day.

Some 12 per cent admitted to using a gadget once a day, six per cent said they went online just once a week and a mere two per cent said it was less than that.

Addicted: Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it

In the largest ever systematic study of emails - examining more than 16 billion messages - researchers have found that most people send replies containing just five words.  

The study, which was conducted by researchers at Yahoo Labs and the University of Southern California, also found that our email habits also follow remarkable patterns.

Replies become faster as the conversation progresses, but the researchers found they could tell when a email thread was about to end as the last reply was much slower than the previous replies.

'The long delay in a reply could be considered as a signal for the end of the conversation,' said the researchers, led by Farshad Kooti, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California.

The study examined the emails sent by two million Yahoo users over a period of several months.

They found that on average younger people tend to spend less time composing an email - with a reply time of around 13 minutes on average for teenagers.

Young adults take 16 minutes, while those aged 36 to 50 years old spend around 24 minutes before sending their reply. 

Phone ownership was almost ubiquitous among young people, meaning they grow up used to being able to access anything any time they want.

The Pew study found that nearly three-quarters of teens have access to a smartphone.

Some 30 per cent have a basic phone and just 12 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds have no phone of any kind.

The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where the text and images disappears seconds after they are sent.

The service has been blamed for a rise in ‘sexting’, where young people send explicit pictures to each other.

Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it.

Amanda Lenhart, the lead author and associate director of research at the Pew Research Centre, said: ‘There’s been a huge diversification of social media.

‘If you are wondering where your child is, you probably need to cast a wide net, because there is a variety of places where your teen could be spending his or her social media time’

Previous studies have starkly illustrated the extent to which young people are addicted to their mobiles.

Smartphone users check their devices an average of 150 times a day as they cannot bear to be apart from them, one research paper showed.

The study showed that we are so addicted to their mobiles that we cannot go 10 minutes without fiddling around with them.

FC United of Manchester was set up as a club in protest of the Glazer family 's takeover of Manchester United . Their 1-0 over Stourbridge on Tuesday night has sealed their fourth promotion as Evo-Stik Northern Premier Champions . It means that the club are just two promotions off the Football League .
-----------------------------------------------
FC United of Manchester, the club set up in protest at the Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United, are now two promotions away from the Football League.

On an emotional night in front of 3,588 noisy fans the Rebels, soon to celebrate their 10th anniversary, sealed the fourth promotion of their short history with this nervy win over Stourbridge saw them crowned Evo-Stik Northern Premier champions.

Hundreds of ecstatic supporters invaded the pitch at the final whistle as the breakaway outfit secured elevation to the sixth tier after the heartbreak of no less than four play-off defeats.

FC United of Manchester players celebrate securing promotion following a 1-0 win over Stourbidge

The club's fourth promotion in their short history sees them come within two more of the Football League

FC will move to a new 5,000 capacity stadium of their own in May, ending a nomadic existence spent entirely on the road.

And it was the Tameside Stadium, home of neighbours Curzon Ashton, that hosted the latest chapter in an already significant history.

In a tense first-half winger Craig Lindfield, a building estimator, headed against the bar as the home side struggled to break down a resolute Stourbridge defence.

And it appeared not to be their night when sub Shelton Payne had a volley cleared off the line.

But on 69 minutes student and full back Greg Daniels rose unmarked to head home the impressive Lindfield's cross and spark joyous scenes.

It was the perfect finish from the former Macclesfield apprentice who was last week painting houses while on holiday from university.

FC came into existence in 2005 when a group of United supporters, despairing of the debt-burdening Old Trafford takeover by the US-based family, decided enough was enough and created their own democratically-run club which kicked off at the bottom of the pyramid in North West Counties Division Two.

From an initial meeting of a dozen at a curry house in the Rusholme district of Manchester they now boast more than 4,000 members, each of whom can claim to be an owners.

Many of those were in fine voice here.

Meanwhile, 30 miles down the road the Class of '92's Salford City celebrated promotion from the Evo-Stik Division One after title rivals Darlington 1883 could only draw 1-1 at Warrington Town.

That result means the club, partly owned by United legends Phil and Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, were crowned champions in the high-profile quintet's first season at the helm.

FC United manager Karl Marginson, who has been with the club since day one, believes 'anything is possible'.

'We've got a ground of our own,' he said, before a fan planted a kiss on his cheek.

'There's no reason why the league is not possible. We have to provide that for these supporters because they deserve it.'

Marginson admits he did not know what to expect when he took over the fledgling club.

'I didn't know what to think,' he said.

'I didn't have a clue. But it's something I'm immensely proud of. It's something we have to hold onto.'

Fans storm the pitch as the breakaway outfit celebrates a significant moment in their short history

When asked how he was going to celebrate Marginson added: 'I'm going to go to the Nag's Head if it's open when I get home.'

General Manager Andy Walsh, who has also been with FC from the beginning, echoed his manager's comments.

'We will assess where we are going to go,' he said. 'We're not in a hurry and we've always been about building for the long-term. This is a football club that is built on the ambitions and beliefs of its supporters.

'I think the Football League is very possible. We have a manager and coaching staff that have shown they can challenge. I firmly believe they can manage and coach in the Football League and I hope it's with us.'

Players carry a champions banner across the pitch as the club sets their sights on the big-time

With just a bird, a gas lamp and a net, each morning, fishermen in China keep a special, thousand year old tradition alive

The stunning images were captured on the River Li in Guilin, China, by a Russian photographer called Viktoriia Rogotneva.

The 45-year-old, from St Petersburg, was captivated upon visiting the fishermen in the town.

'Every fishermen has a reed raft, a few trained cormorants and a small source of light - usually a kerosene lamp,' he said.

'In the morning the fishermen go to the river and let the cormorants go. The birds are very hungry and dive into the water to catch big carp.'

The fishermen quite literally just take the carp right out of the bird's mouth after the hungry animals return with their haul

These breathtaking early morning images were captured by 45-year-old Viktoriaa Rogotneva from St Petersburg, Russia

'The cormorants then return to the surface of the water, and the fishermen take the fish right out the bird's beak,' Rogotneva added.

The elderly fishermen of Guiliin spend between two and three hours on the lake each every morning, and while cormorant fishing only produces about 4kg of carp per day, the men are determined to keep this special practice alive. 

To control the birds, the fishermen tie a ring near the base of the bird's throat, which prevents them from swallowing any large fish, but allows them to eat smaller fish with no discomfort.

The images were all shot on the River Li in Guilin, China, which is in the southern part of the country

Heading out in the dawn's light, each man is equipped only with a reed raft, a few trained cormorants and a small kerosene light source

The elderly fishermen spend anywhere between two to three hours per day on the lake, despite the low yields from cormorant fishing

On average, the men will only produce about 4kg of carp per day, but are still determined to keep this beautiful practice alive =

This fishermen bring up the birds from when they are tiny chicks, so the cormorant is more of a pet than a hunter

This way of fishing is 'absolutely ecologically safe,' says Rogotneva, who insists that the fishermen catch only as much as they need

Rogotneva said: 'These fishermen bring up their birds from when they are very small chicks, so you can almost call the cormorant a pet, like you would a dog.

'It is an absolutely ecologically safe way of fishing. Every fisherman just catches as much as he needs for his family and they are never greedy.

'I really enjoy looking for these unusual moments, they make for beautiful photos.'

A series of unpublished love letters from Mexican artist Frida Kahlo to her lover Jose Bartoli are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 when the passionate missives go up for auction later this 

During her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, Frida penned the letters to Jose, a Catalan artist whom she met while she was recovering from surgery in New York. Their steamy correspondence began shortly after she returned to Mexico following the trip and continued throughout their secret three-year romance. 

'I don’t know how to write love letters. But I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you,' then-39-year-old Frida wrote in October of 1946.

Secret romance: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (pictured) wrote passionate love letters to Jose Bartoli from 1946 and 1949 while she was married to muralist Diego Rivera

Enduring love: A collection of 25 of the unpublished letters will be auctioned off at Doyle New York on April 15

She continued: 'Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty… love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain.'

The letters, 25 of which are headed to auction at Doyle New York on April 15, were written in Spanish between August 1946 and November 1949 and saved by Jose until his death in 1995.

The archive of passionate messages, which comprise more than 100 pages, were passed down through different generations his family until they reached the current owner. 

According to Frida Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera, the artist told Jose to sign his letters as 'Sonja' so that Diego would think they were from a woman if he came across them.  

High price: The letters (pictured) are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 dollars 

Pet names: Frida signed her letters to Jose 'Mara', which biographer Hayden Herrera explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her

Creative couple: Jose, a Catalan artist, can be seen sitting at an easel as he works on a painting 

Handle with care: This letter from the archive shows a stain on the right hand corner of the paper

Famous works: In this letter, Frida refers to 'Tree of Hope', a painting she created shortly after she met Jose 

Diego, a muralist and a notorious Lothario, who once had an affair with Frida's younger sister Cristina, endured Frida's love affairs with women, but her relationships with other men would drive him to bouts of crazed jealousy. 

Meanwhile, Frida inscribed her letters with the name 'Mara', which Hayden explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her. 

The collection also includes an original drawing of a sleeping cat, pressed flowers, ribbon, beads and drafts of a few of Jose's responses.

Frida's candid messages to her lover shed light on her important paintings, an unknown pregnancy and her relationship with Diego, as well as her adoration for her Jose.

Sketch artist: Frida sent Jose this drawing of a tree in reference to 'The Tree of Life' 

City living: Frida posed for this photo in front of a skyline. She and Jose met when she was recovering from surgery in a hospital in New York 

Long distance love: Frida ended this letter to Jose with a kiss, leaving behind a lipstick print of her mouth 

Their secret affair began when Frida, who was left a partial cripple after a 1925 bus accident, was recovering from a spinal fusion performed in June, 1946 at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery. 

Frida's sister Cristina was the one to introduce her to Jose, who moved to New York after fighting in the Spanish Civil War. They fell in love during his visits to the hospital and continued their long-distance courtship after she returned to Mexico. 

After Frida sold her 1946 painting Tree of Hope, which was inspired by her recent surgery, she wrote to Jose about his words influenced her creation.  

'I remembered your last words and I began to paint,' she explained. 'I worked all morning and when I finished eating I kept on painting until there was no more light. But afterward I felt so tired and everything hurt.'

An artist's life: Frida was photographed holding this statue while she stood in front of a blue cement wall 

Inspired work: Frida sketched this drawing of a sleeping cat and sent it to Jose 

Added images: This letter featured a picture of a women sleeping in a bed while another walked away 

Last words: Frida ends this letter by telling Jose that she loves him

Epic romance: In this letter Frida told Jose she loves him the way that he is 

In the painting one version of Frida lies in a hospital bed, while another depiction of herself sits proudly while holding a flag.

While painting the piece, Frida inscribed 'Tree of Hope Keep Firm' a line of a song that she and Jose both liked. 

According to Hayden, Frida wrote in several of her letters to Jose that she had missed her period, in a way that suggested she was in some ways hoping to have his baby despite knowing it was nearly impossible because of her spinal injury.

'If I were not in the condition I am in now and if it were a reality, nothing in my life would give me more joy. Can you imagine a little Bartoli or a Mara?' she wrote.

Chelsea Clinton is opening up about life in the public eye, being a new mother and whether or not she would like to see her own mother become president in a new interview.

Clinton, whose mother Hillary is expected to formally announce her presidential campaign this Sunday, said it is time the United States had a female leader.

'One of our core values in this country is that we are the land of equal opportunity, but when equal hasn't yet included gender, there is a fundamental challenge there that, I believe, having our first woman president—whenever that is—will help resolve,' said Clinton.

Chelsea Clinton has come a long way from being the adolescent that grew up in front of our eyes while her dad was POTUS. Yes, Chelsea is now a mom, wife, and advocate for women.

Being the daughter of two of the most influential people on the planet doesn't seem to faze Chelsea. She gave a candid interview to Elle magazine this month about motherhood and talks of how her own mom should be the first female president of the United States.

In between the interview she was able to take a few editorial shots in all black outfits. Her cover look is a fitted black dress with cut out detail by Gucci. We love the fitted silhouette and cut-out that takes a basic LBD to new stylish heights. You can get Chelsea's dress now at Neiman's for  $1500.

'I now understand all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children,' says Clinton of her daughter (Above with her family shortly after the birth)

In the interview with Elle, Clinton does not however say too much about her mother's campaign plans, and focuses instead on the general lack of female representation in politics.

'We've made real progress on legal protections for women, but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace,' she explains.

'And if we look in the political sphere, it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success. Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality?'

She then adds; 'And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president, absolutely it's important, for, yes, symbolic reasons—symbols are important; it is important who and what we choose to elevate, and to celebrate.'

Clinton, who looks almost unrecognizable in the accompanying fashion spread, also talks about life with daughter Charlotte. 

Clinton says that though the US is the 'land of equal opportunity,' that is not true about gender, and a female president would change that

'I now understand—this is something else that Marc and I talk about all the time—all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children, because we also feel and think all those things about Charlotte,' said Clinton.

And now, almost 25 years after she first hit the campaign trail as a child, Clinton seems ready to do it all over again, as the 35-year-old may once again return to the role of first daughter. 

Elle's editor-in-chief Robbie Myers is certainly excited about this prospect, describing Clinton as 'innately regal' in her editor's letter.

'She’s a person of substance for sure, a young woman who, while measured in her manner, has a fierceness of conviction, and a calling to make the world a better place,' says Myers.

Clinton meanwhile is focused on seeing that first female president.

'Yes, we've seen again and again, when women have been in positions of leadership, they have had different degrees of success versus their male counterparts, historically being able to build more consensus so that decisions have longer-term effects, whether in economic investments or in building social capital,' says Clinton. 

'Who sits around the table matters. And who sits at the head of the table matters, too.'

As for her mom, her big announcement is expected to come on Twitter, and from there she is off to Iowa to get to work.

Aaron Hernandez will serve life in Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center outside Boston . Souza opened in 1998 and is one of the most high-tech jails in the United States . It 's also `` dangerous , '' `` sterile '' and `` violent , '' a legal advocate for inmates says .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Prison life won't be pretty for Aaron Hernandez, the former NFL player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole.

After correction officers evaluate him, he will be shipped to Massachusetts' flagship maximum-security prison, one of the most high-tech jails in the United States with no history of breakouts: the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, about 40 miles outside downtown Boston.

It's called Souza, for short, and it's the state's newest prison, opened in 1998, with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire.

"I don't know the date, but he'll be going there. That's the maximum-security facility," Department of Corrections spokesman Darren Duarte said.

Legal advocates for inmates describe Souza as sterile and violent at once. Its diverse demographic includes the young and the old, many of whom are also doing life. One stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates, the legal advocates said.

"It's very shiny and clean looking and very sterile," said Leslie Walker, executive director of Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, who has been visiting the Souza prison about every six weeks for the past 15 years and serves indigent prisoners there.

But, she added: "It is a very dangerous prison that is right now experiencing a veritable flood of opiates."

Officials said Hernandez, 25, is being processed at the maximum-security Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Cedar Junction in Walpole, just a handful of miles from Gillette Stadium, where he once played tight end for the New England Patriots under a five-year $40 million contract.

The prison system has yet to determine where to initially place Hernandez in Souza: solitary confinement; the less harsh but restricted block; the general population; a privileged section known as the "lifers block," for those serving a life sentence; or the "kitchen block," for those who work in the prison kitchen.

"At this point in time, we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of Hernandez is complete," Duarte said. "Right now, he'll be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door, but they will figure all that out."

Hernandez was sent immediately for processing after Wednesday's sentencing and jury conviction, Duarte said. A news outlet helicopter followed Hernandez's transfer to MCI Cedar Junction.

Prison officials will be concerned about Hernandez's safety and whether any enemies, gangs or headline-seeking inmates will try to hurt Hernandez, who will become Souza's most famous resident.

"There could be prisoners with a beef who are out to get him," Walker said. "Then he's going to have to be separated, and it's going to be challenging for prison officers and perhaps for him.

"The good news is that the superintendent of Souza-Baranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being, who I'm sure will do everything he can to keep Mr. Hernandez safe," Walker added. "The person at the top sets the tone. He's fairly new and he's doing everything he can to make sure the prison is as safe as possible."

That superintendent, Osvaldo Vidal, couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.

Because of his celebrity, Hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards, said Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high- and minimum-security prisons.

"There will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is, but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star," said Levine, who founded Wall Street Prison Consultants, which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison.

In the long run, however, it may not matter much in what section of the prison Hernandez does his time.

About 90% of the inmates in the maximum-security prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day, said Walker, the legal advocate.

"It's pretty grim," Walker said.

Souza has slightly larger cells than most other Massachusetts prisons, but not by much, Walker said.

Even so, the cells are stark, small rooms of painted cinder-block walls with metal fixtures: a bunk mounted to the wall, a toilet and sink combination, a small writing shelf attached to the wall, and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor, Walker said.

There's also a shelf for a small television, which must have a clear back for easy inspection, Walker said.

With the exception of the TV, which inmates can buy for under $200, all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them, she said.

There are two windows: one roughly 4 by 20 inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall, building or trees, and a tiny window on the cell door, which has two slots, for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door, she said.

"There's very little to do," Walker said of inmate life. "It was built as a punishment facility. The thing in corrections is that you don't want people to like it there. Some people have been there since it opened, and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both."

To combat opiate use among inmates, prison guards use narcotics-sniffing dogs for inspections, Walker said.

"It's pretty pathetic. I have clients (in Souza prison) who are heroin addicts who are trying to get clean," Walker said.

There also are gangs in the prison, she said. As for violence, one elderly inmate was beaten to death last year, Walker said.

If Hernandez finds himself in solitary confinement, it won't be pleasant, Walker said.

"Solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in. The lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad," Walker said.

Initially, "prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety, but I hope not," Walker said. "It's very hard time."

Opinion: The shame of Aaron Hernandez

A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight.

Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago.

The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing.

Scroll down for video 

The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap

Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air.

The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air.

A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile.

Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. 

These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs.

The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian.

The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought.

The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones.

Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features

Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight.

Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor.

These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds.

But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats.

Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made.

'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs.

'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives.

'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded.

'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.'

The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex.

The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China.

The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings.

However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists.

There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.

Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds.

However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat.

This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly.

The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual

This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head

Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels.

The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight.

Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances.

But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning "strange wing" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind

'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.'

It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors.

Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds.

'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.'

Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all.

The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China

The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g)

He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done.

‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall.

‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem.

‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies.

‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’

Bobbi Kristina Brown has `` global and irreversible '' brain damage , her grandmother says . `` We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time , '' Cissy Houston says . Bobby Brown , her father , had said at a concert that she was `` awake ''
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Bobbi Kristina Brown, the daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, has "global and irreversible brain damage," according to her grandmother.

Though the 22-year-old is no longer in a medically induced coma, she remains unresponsive, Cissy Houston said in a statement Monday after visiting her granddaughter.

"Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me," Houston said. "We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time."

Houston's statement matched that from a source with knowledge of Brown's condition, who told CNN on Monday that she remained in the same neurological state she has been in for nearly three months.

She does not respond to visitors or familiar voices, and her eyes do not follow a person around the room, the source told CNN. She also has a tracheostomy in her throat, the source said.

The reports come two days after Brown's father, Bobby Brown, said his daughter's condition had improved.

"I can say today, Bobbi is awake. She's watching me," Brown told the audience at Dallas' Verizon Theatre.

The audience cheered.

In a statement Monday, an attorney for the Brown family said that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved but that the kind of life she will lead remains to be seen.

"Doctors have indicated that she will have a long life," attorney Christopher Brown said. "However, Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process, and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come."

Who's who in the Bobbi Kristina Brown case?

Bobby Brown was in an "emotional state" on stage when he made the remarks about his daughter being awake, according to the statement.

"She has made it out of ICU, opened her eyes and started a rehabilitation that will be long and hard," said Bobby Brown's wife, Alicia Etheredge-Brown.

Ed Miliband said the crisis was ` in part a direct result ' of the PM 's policy . Miliband made a rare address on the issue of foreign policy in London . Senior Conservatives accused Miliband of exploiting a human tragedy . Liam Fox claimed the Labour leader was ` weaponise drowning migrants '
-----------------------------------------------
Ed Miliband was accused of plunging the General Election campaign to a ‘new low’ last night by ‘weaponising dead migrants’.

The Labour leader and his party’s spin machine prompted the most bitter row of the campaign so far by suggesting that David Cameron bore personal responsibility for drownings of refugees in the Mediterranean.

Senior Conservatives claimed Mr Miliband was effectively ‘accusing the Prime Minister of murder’ in a ‘desperate and negative’ attempt to score political points by exploiting a human tragedy.

Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of trying to make political capital from the Mediterranean tragedy 

Ed Miliband claimed the Mediterranean crisis was 'in part a direct result' of the PM's Libya policy

The controversy began after Labour spin doctors issued a briefing note which said Mr Miliband would use a speech on foreign policy to say the ‘tragic scenes’ in the Mediterranean were ‘in part a direct result’ of Mr Cameron’s Libya policy.

The Labour leader later insisted he was not saying Mr Cameron had ‘blood on his hands’, but was making a ‘very important point about post-conflict planning in Libya’ after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. The Prime Minister said only that Mr Miliband’s remarks were ‘ill- judged’.

But a senior Tory source said: ‘A few bad polls for Labour after a poor week of campaigning and Ed Miliband accuses the PM of murder. I think we can see who is getting desperate and running a negative and personal campaign.’

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also condemned Labour’s intervention, pointing out that Mr Miliband had backed Western military involvement in Libya.

He accused Labour of astonishing hypocrisy, given the catastrophic failure of post-war planning in its Iraq conflict.

Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 5 live: ‘I think it is quite distasteful, actually, to reduce this total human tragedy of hundreds of people dying out in the Mediterranean to a political point-scoring blame game, particularly, I have to say, from a party that of course brought us into an illegal invasion in Iraq where there was no planning at all for the aftermath.’

Mr Clegg said there should be ‘a little more adherence to the facts as to who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can do about it to stop this terrible human tragedy’.

Former foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Miliband’s remarks represented ‘a new low in shallow opportunism’, given that the Labour leader had said ‘nothing’ about foreign policy for five years.

Former Tory minister Richard Benyon accused Mr Miliband of ‘weaponising dead migrants’. He said a large percentage of those fleeing North Africa ‘come from other countries than Libya so Miliband is wrong on every level’.

And former defence secretary Liam Fox said: ‘Having tried to weaponise the NHS, Miliband is trying to weaponise drowning migrants. It’s quite offensive and reflects extremely badly on both him and his party.’

Mr Miliband, speaking at the Chatham House think-tank in London, was forced to deny that he had ‘politicised’ a tragedy.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Miliband was trying to 'weaponise drowning migrants'  

Asked if that was true, Mr Miliband replied: ‘Nonsense. No. Look, what this is about is saying very clearly to the British people that there is a huge issue we face as a country which is learning the lessons of the 2003 Iraq War.

‘The problem is that in relation to Libya we have repeated the mistake because we haven’t done the post-conflict planning.

‘I think people should just read my words and I don’t think anybody in the foreign policy community or in the wider international community would disagree with what I’ve said about the failure of post-conflict planning.’

Labour aides pointed out that Mr Miliband did raise the issue of post-war plans after supporting bombing raids in Libya in 2011.

But footage of him also emerged from the same year suggesting the new Libyan authorities should be left to get on with it.

‘This is an important moment to recognise the National Transitional Council and their role in taking Libya forward, and we’ve got to be led by them. It’s very important that Libyans determine their future,’ he said at the time.

Labour’s shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker was forced to concede that Mr Cameron is not responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean. ‘Nobody would want to say that the Prime Minister, as a human being, would want to see the terrible things we have seen in the Med,’ he said.

In a bruising interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil, Mr Coaker also struggled to explain when Mr Miliband had raised ‘consistent concerns’ about the issue of post-conflict planning.

A senior Labour source said the party ‘did not resile from anything’ in its briefing note and accused critics of a ‘silly, utterly spurious’ response to a ‘serious speech’.

Labour accused the Tories of ‘personal attacks’ earlier in the campaign, when Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband ‘stabbed his brother in the back’ in the party’s 2010 leadership contest.

Aaron Bee , 22 , spent two weeks on the run from Lincolnshire Police . The father of one posted taunting selfies on Facebook over 13 days . Officers finally caught up with him at a cafe in Lincoln in November . He was has now been jailed for eight months over domestic violence .
-----------------------------------------------
A fugitive who taunted authorities by taking selfies outside police stations while he was on the run has finally been jailed. 

Aaron Bee was wanted by Lincolnshire Police over an alleged domestic violence and assault.

After fleeing his home, the 22-year-old  goaded officers by sharing photographs online which showed him standing outside the force's headquarters.

He was eventually arrested in November in a cafe after posing outside five different police stations over two weeks and was this week jailed for eight months. 

Aaron Bee went on the run for two weeks last year, taunting the police officers who were chasing him with selfies taken outside their headquarters. He has now been jailed for eight months

But after spending less than five months behind bars since his arrest, the 22-year-old has already been released.  

Last year Bee taunted officers by captioning photographs 'come catch me if you can' and bragging that he was 'always playing hide and seek'.

He visited five different police stations without being apprehended and even flashing his genitals outside one. 

The father of one had been wanted by police for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend after showing up at her house in the middle of the night. 

Lincoln Crown Court heard how he had been 'threatening and abusive' towards the woman when he 'kicked her door down' last October.

Before his arrest Bee said he was taunting police 'as a bit of fun'. He was jailed yesterday for eight months but has been released after spending less than five months behind bars since being arrested 

When police couldn't find him after the assault they released his mugshot to appeal for his whereabouts. 

In response, Bee took to Facebook to mock their efforts. Among pictures he shared online was one of a police officer standing in the street which he captioned 'is it me you're looking for'. 

He also posed outside Lincolnshire Police HQ, looking towards the camera and giving a thumbs up. 

In other posts he said the justice system 'is really f****d up' and bragged about buying a doughnut in Tesco without being caught. 

At the time, he said he was taunting police 'because it's funny.' 

He told reporters: 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me,' without disclosing his whereabouts.  

The 22-year-old made several jibes on Facebook, joking that he needed new hiding places after being hunted for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend 

While on the run Bee mocked police officers by uploading a photograph of one with the caption 'hello is it me your (sic) looking for'. He was arrested in mid November and remanded into custody

Before his arrest Bee bemoaned being hunted by police for 'a poxy assaut'. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he grabbed his former girlfriend by the throat when he broke a non-molestation order to turn up at her house 

He was eventually arrested in a cafe in Lincoln before being brought before court. 

Sentencing, Judge Michael Heath said: 'The non-molestation order was made in April 2013 by a County Court judge.

'He did not make it for fun. He made it to afford protection to the person who applied for it who was your erstwhile partner.

'When a judge makes a non-molestation order he expects that it will be obeyed.

'If it isn't you go inside. If you breach the non-molestation order again the sentences will get longer and longer.'

Bee was jailed for eight months but is likely to be released imminently after being kept behind bars since November.

But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield.

He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen.

'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical.

'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table.

'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy.

'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had.

'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.'

Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield

Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. 

White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since.

While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down.

He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday.

A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived.

'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said.

'Of course, it'll all end in tears.

'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'.

'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough.

Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday

'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'.

'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me.

'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.'

Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories.

Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis

The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again.

'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said.

'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times.

'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

South Korean adventure seekers have founded a surfing community near the country 's border with the North . The demilitarized zone , separating the North and South , features the world 's largest border military presence . The community consists of Seoul 's growing jet-setting adventure class , hipsters , gangsters and ex-pats .
-----------------------------------------------
It is cold, remote, dangerous, and a hot spot for one of the world's most volatile and entrenched political stand-offs.

So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class.

Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations.

The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South. 

Surfer Shannon Aston, from New Zealand, said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in South Korea as a teacher.

Mr Aston added: 'The military is ever present and must be respected and everybody does (respect it), but Korea has been divided for decades, so life just goes on.

'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.'

The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said.

He said: 'Most surfers will ride waves wherever they can, extreme cold, lakes, river and everything in between.

'Most don't care too much as long as they can surf. The Korean surfers are used to it and the foreigners just feel lucky to get some waves in a place where it is not famous for surfing.

Three rabbis found guilty of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in New Jersey federal court . They were accused of orchestrating kidnapping , torture of Jewish men who refused to allow their wives a religious divorce . Lawyers for the rabbis said they plan on appealing the verdicts .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Three Orthodox rabbis accused of planning and participating in the torture of Jewish men who refused to divorce their wives were convicted Tuesday of conspiring to commit kidnapping.

Rabbis Mendel Epstein, 69; Jay Goldstein, 60; and Binyamin Stimler, 39, were found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in New Jersey federal court. Goldstein and Stimler were also convicted on charges of attempted kidnapping.

The rabbis were part of a ring accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of Jewish husbands to persuade them through torture involving electric cattle prods and screwdrivers to grant "gets," a document that Jewish law requires a husband to present to his wife in order to be issued a divorce, court papers said.

The men were arrested in October 2013 following an FBI sting operation that ended with Goldstein, Stimler and six other men with ski masks, surgical blades and a 30-foot nylon rope in a warehouse in Middlesex County, New Jersey.

Lawyers for each of the rabbis told CNN they plan on appealing the convictions.

"Rabbi Epstein still firmly believes that he was protecting women's rights and was protecting the agunahs and the families," said Robert Stahl, the lawyer for Epstein.

Without a "get," a woman is considered an "agunah," a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over the marriage might actually be.

An Orthodox Jewish woman who does not receive a get runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she moves on. Any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards.

"I don't think this was a traditional kidnapping," said Aidan O'Connor, the lawyer for Goldstein.

Goldstein is a sofer, a Jewish scribe who transcribes the Torah and writes other religious documents, including divorce papers, his attorney said.

Nathan Lewin, the attorney for Stimler, called the verdict "shocking" and said his client was only present at the warehouse as a witness for the ceremonial signing of the document.

"There's no evidence that Rabbi Stimler knew what was going to be going on," Lewin said. "Of course we're going to take all the steps to correct this injustice."

Epstein's son, David Epstein, was acquitted on Tuesday of kidnapping charges.

The jury returned not guilty verdicts on the attempted kidnapping charges against Mendel Epstein, and on more severe kidnapping charges against the three rabbis.

Nine other individuals previously pled guilty in the case to conspiracy charges, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey.

Henry Mazurek, the lawyer for David Epstein, said his client was grateful for the jury's decision but called his client's acquittals "bittersweet" next to his father's conviction.

"He really believes that (his father) was a champion of someone who was voiceless in his religion," Mazurek said.

Sentencing is set for July 15. The men face up to life in prison.

-----------------------------------------------
With a luxurious 88-square-foot cabin and space to fit 20 passengers in boardroom-style comfort, the Bell 525 Relentless is likely to make some high-flyers seriously happy when it takes to the skies this year. 

The manufacturers of the state-of-the-art helicopter, Textron, are yet to officially release a price but industry observers are listing it at a whopping $15million (£10.12m) for what looks effectively like a living room that can fly just about anywhere. 

Once it flies for the first time a little behind schedule, the helicopter will cruise at a maximum of 178 miles per hour and with its 2,4000-litre fuel capacity be able to fly up to 575 miles without stopping.

The Bell 525 Relentless is due to make its maiden flight this year with purchasers forking out $15million (£10.12m) for their own

The commercial helicopter has a luxurious 88-square-foot cabin and space to fit 20 passengers in boardroom-style comfort

A range of configurations can be chosen by the buyers, who are expected to use the craft for offshore oil and gas missions

The craft is aimed to be a limo in the sky for offshore oil and operations and also expects to be used for difficult search-and-rescue and firefighting missions due to its huge capacity and improved control in tough conditions.,

'The Bell 525 Relentless is a marvel of modern technology that will provide our customers capability beyond expectations,' Fred Hees, CEO of BBM Inc which is one of the first companies to purchase the 525, told helicopterinvestor.com.

The company says their Bell 525 will be configured to 'perform head of state transport throughout the region' while another purchaser K Aircraft Leasing, will rent their two 525s out to Middle East-based oil and gas companies.

Ireland-based Waypoint Leasing has also tentatively agreed to buy 20 of the helicopters, reports the Wall Street Journal, before the craft even makes it maiden flight. 

One early buyer calls the helicopter, which looks like a living room that can fly anywhere, 'a marvel of modern technology'

Another deluxe interior option for the helicopter which looks like it should be a private jet rather than a helicopter

Depending on the configuration of the interior, the 525 will hold 16 or 20 passengers along with the two flight crew with what the builders say is best in class passenger cabin height (137cm) and floor area (8.2 square metres).

The 525 is also the first commercial helicopter to incorporate fly-by-wire flight controls, which they say delivers 'superior handling qualities and increased level of safety' with features that, among other things, stabilise the aircraft without the need of input from the pilot.

The exterior has an advanced aerodynamic design, a Next Generation GE engine and 'best-in-class payload-range capability'

For the technically savvy, it is also the first commercial craft if its kind to include the Garmin G5000H, a glass touchscreen avionics suite for the flight deck that replaces knobs and switches with what they say are simpler controls and information, such as weather, charts, traffic, terrain and Global connectivity options, for the pilot. For the 525 it's been rebranded as the ARC Horizon system. 

The slick exterior of the chopper, which looks like something Iron Man wouldn't be adverse to taking a ride in, of course has an advanced aerodynamic design, a Next Generation GE engine and an airframe that offers 'best-in-class payload-range capability'.

Gloucester winger Jonny May is hoping to get over being dropped by England with victory in next month’s Challenge Cup final.

After beating Exeter 30-19 in their last-four tie, the Cherry and Whites now face Edinburgh at the Twickenham Stoop on May 1 and could claim their first European trophy since 2006.

For May, who was overlooked for the last three rounds of the RBS 6 Nations, it is the ideal stage to boost his World Cup selection chances.

The clip , which was created by The Daily Share , compares near-identical products for men and women and highlights the price differences . According to the creators of the video , California is one of the few states to have put a ban on ` gender pricing discrimination '
-----------------------------------------------
A newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men,  

The clip, which was created by HLN's The Daily Share, illustrates the prevalence of this 'women's tax' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences.

Even more disappointing is that this practice of 'invisible tax' is not only found almost everywhere, but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the US - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders.

Scroll down for video 

That price could use a shave: The Daily Share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men's and women's versions

Compounded with the fact that women make, on average, 78 cents on the dollar to men, the facts prove than gender bias is more than just offensive, it's also very expensive.

For example, a Schick’s Hydro 5 men’s razor was picked up for $8.56, but the women's version - the Schick Hydro Silk - was, for some reason, given more than a one dollar mark-up, and was priced at $9.97. 

An even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle, where Narciso Rodriguez Eau de Toilettes For Him and For Her respectively cost $87 and $106.60.

Meanwhile, a pair of Neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging. 

One of the few equal prices found by the video's creators was, of course, on a unisex American Apparel shirt. But when a man and a woman each dropped off the exact same shirt to get dry-cleaned, the woman was charged an extra 75 cents - and the tag even labelled the laundered item as a 'Lady Shirt'. 

Something smells fishy: There is almost a ful 20 dollar difference between the his and hers versions of this brand of cologne

Seriously? The presenters claim that the exact same shirt dropped off at a dry cleaners cost more to clean when a woman brought it in

The two presenters do point out that conditions are getting slightly better; medical insurance used to cost women in America $1 billion more each year before ObamaCare outlawed the practice of gender-biased pricing discrimination.

However, in terms of everyday gender-taxing across the country, a 1995 report found that 'gender tax' cost women approximately $1,351 annually - a number which doesn't show any signs of decreasing any time soon.

And while the shocking statistics in the caused California to put a state-wide ban on the practice in 1996, with New York City also opting to impose a similar ban on gender pricing, the rest of the US continues to allow the practice.

Even something as basic as long-term care insurance costs women 13 per cent more, a hike they apparently base on the fact that women have longer life-spans - in the same way that they raise rates on smokers. 

'But people choose to smoke,' says the female presenter. 'I didn't choose to be a woman.'

-----------------------------------------------
Andros Townsend hailed Harry Kane as the 'best finisher' he has played with and predicted a bright international career for his Tottenham Hotspur team-mate.

Kane made his England debut as a substitute on Friday against Lithuania, scoring after only 79 seconds, and started last night's friendly against Italy in Turin when Townsend scored in a 1-1 draw.

Townsend said: 'I've known Harry for the last four, five or six years, I've grown up in the youth team with him and he is a fantastic talent and a player who, if you give him a chance, he is always going to put it away.

'I think a few years ago, the main criticism was that he was lacking half a yard of pace and he has seemed to sort that out. He has bulked up and is now an animal and hopefully Spurs and England can benefit from that.

'I have always said to people that he is the best finisher I have ever played with. 

'People used to laugh at me but now I think I should get a job as a scout.

'Even in training, left or right foot he is always working the 'keeper. He can find himself in almost any position and he will hit the bottom or top corner. 

'That part of the game he has always had but the other side of the game to be fair to him, he has really worked on and I think Spurs and England are seeing the benefits of that.'

Townsend insists he has always told people that Kane is the 'best finisher I have ever played with'

Ryan Mason won his first cap in Turin and with Kyle Walker also coming off the bench it meant England finished the game with four Spurs players on the pitch, three from the academy. Danny Rose had pulled out of the squad with hip and hamstring injuries.

Townsend added: 'The management, the coaches and the academy managers should be proud. 

'They have brought through four or five players - Danny Rose as well - who are in the England squad and four players on the pitch at one time tonight is fantastic for the club and hopefully it can be an inspiration to the younger players, the likes of Josh Onomah and Harry Winks who are coming through, that they can be in the first team.'

`` The Cold War has been over for a long time , '' President Obama says . The thaw in ties has dominated discussion at the Summit of the Americas in Panama . The top leaders from the United States and Cuba have n't met for substantive talks in more than 50 years .
-----------------------------------------------
Panama City, Panama (CNN)Ending a decades-long standstill in U.S.-Cuba relations, President Barack Obama met for an hour Saturday with his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro, the first time the two nations' top leaders have sat down for substantive talks in more than 50 years.

The meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas came as the two countries work to end the Cold War enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties. And while both leaders proclaimed progress had been made, a key stumbling block -- Cuba's place on the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terror -- remained unresolved.

"This is obviously an historic meeting," Obama said at the beginning of his session with Castro, claiming that decades of strain had done little to benefit either Cubans or citizens of the United States.

"It was time for us to try something new," he said. ‎"We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future."

Castro, who earlier in the day said he trusted Obama, acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks as his nation works to repair ties with the United States. But he said those differences could be surmounted.

"We are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient, very patient," Castro said. "We might disagree on something today on which we could agree tomorrow."

Speaking to reporters after his session with Castro, Obama said the meeting was "candid and fruitful" and could prove to be a "turning point" in his push to defrost ties with Cuba.

But he said he hadn't yet decided whether to remove Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror, an outcome that had previously been expected during the summit. The State Department provided Obama with a review of the terror status this week.

"I want to make sure I have a chance to read it, study it before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be," Obama said. "But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people to people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for Cuban people."

On Friday night, Obama and Castro greeted each other courteously amid an explosion of camera flashes, shaking hands before dining at the inaugural session of the conference. The two sat at the same table but not directly next to one another.

Before Obama arrived in Panama on Wednesday, he spoke with Castro by phone, laying the groundwork for what will become a new era of relations between the neighboring countries.

"The Cold War has been over for a long time," Obama said during opening remarks at the summit Saturday. "I'm not interested in having battles, frankly, that began before I was born."

That exhortation, however, seemed to be lost on Castro himself, who expanded what was meant to be a six-minute speech into a 50-minute address lecturing leaders on Cuba's revolution and giving a litany of perceived grievances to Cuba over the past 50 years.

But he distinguished Obama from past American presidents, saying he respected Obama's move toward reconciliation.

"In my opinion, President Obama in an honest man," Castro said through an interpreter. "I admire him, and I think his behavior has a lot to do with his humble background."

A U.S. administration official said Castro's long list of grievances was expected, despite the move toward diplomatic ties.

"(What's) unique and new is what he said about the president," the official said of Castro's praise for Obama.

Obama announced in December that he was seeking to renew diplomatic relations with Cuba after half a century of strife, including eventually opening embassies in Washington and Havana.

Obama set to test engagement doctrine with Cuba in Panama

His meeting with Castro on Saturday isn't being billed as a formal bilateral session, but Obama's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest-level engagement with the Cuban government since then-Vice President Richard Nixon met with Fidel Castro in 1959.

"We're in new territory here," Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday. "The reason we're here is because the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation, focused entirely on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed."

The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government.

"A recommendation to remove Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism would represent another significant misstep in a misguided policy," Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who used to the chair the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a statement last week.

In Latin America, however, Obama was receiving a warm welcome after announcing he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel.

9 things you wanted to ask about the Cuban embargo

He noted to applause during a session Friday that this was the first summit with Cuba in attendance. And he's cast the decision to reopen the U.S. relationship with Cuba as beneficial to the entire hemisphere, which has also embraced his immigration executive action.

But even as Obama landed in Panama, the longstanding gulfs between the two countries' governments were on display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted this week by supporters of the Cuban government, a scuffle the White House said was unacceptable.

"As we move toward the process of normalization, we'll have our differences, government to government, with Cuba on many issues -- just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies," Obama said at a meeting of civil society leaders Friday. "There's nothing wrong with that."

"But I'm here to say that when we do speak out, we're going to do so because the United States of America does believe, and will always stand for, a certain set of universal values," he said.

The long history between the U.S. and Cuba

Obama closed out his time in Panama with a news conference where he covered topics ranging from Hillary Clinton's expected presidential announcement to his framework deal with Iran on its nuclear program.

The President had pointed criticism for Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Earlier this week, McCain accused Secretary of State John Kerry of intentionally mischaracterizing what the sides had agreed to in the Iran nuclear deal.

"John Kerry is delusional," McCain said on the Hugh Hewitt show, a conservative talk radio program, adding that the view from the Supreme Leader of Iran of the provisions agreed to "is probably right," rather than what the United States maintains are the agreed provisions.

While discussing the Iran agreement Saturday, Obama brought up those remarks without being asked.

"When I hear someone like Sen. McCain recently suggest that our secretary of state, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, (is) a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this nation, is somehow less trustworthy of the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries," he said at the news conference.

After the President's remarks, McCain tweeted "So Pres. Obama goes to #Panama, meets with Castro and attacks me - I'm sure Raul is pleased."

As for his 2008 Democratic rival, Obama said, "If she decides to run, if she makes an announcement, she's going to have some strong messages to deliver," he said.

Jeremy Clarkson last night launched into a bizarre rant about being sacked from the BBC, saying the upside meant he could now swear without being reprimanded.

The former Top Gear presenter made his comments when he was guest of honour at a charity auction in the Cotswolds.

Opening the auction in aid of Chipping Norton's lido, he said: 'In the olden days when I used to work for BBC, I couldn't say s*** - but I am not, so I will say s***.'

Hundreds of fans paid £15 a ticket to watch Clarkson oversee the auction at Chipping Norton town Hall.

He also joked about 'trawling the job centre' for a hosting job when he spotted an opening for the charity auction.

In a typical Clarkson moment, he mistook a male bidder for a female but responded by saying: 'I have worked with James May, it is easy to get confused in these situations.'

Clarkson, who celebrates his 55th birthday tomorrow, previously lived in a sprawling £900,000 house one mile outside the town.

It was his first public appearance since he was sacked from the BBC for allegedly assaulting a producer in the now infamous row over a steak supper in a Yorkshire hotel.

He was accused of punching producer Oisin Tymon following a day's filming.

Clarkson was due to make his TV comeback as guest host of BBC1's Have I Got News for You on April 23 but he pulled out of the show two weeks before it was due to be filmed.

On Friday, Furious 7 joined the $1 billion club at the worldwide box office, leaping into the top twenty grossing films of all time worldwide.

Over the weekend, Furious 7 added even more to its international total, jumping even higher on the all-time worldwide charts. 

Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, ranking seventh with $1.152 billion.

With Furious 7 still going strong, the question becomes now how high can it climb? The film will almost certainly race past Iron Man 3 and Frozen to join the top five all-time at the worldwide box office before the month is out.

'The film has set a new standard for the potential for box-office in the pre-summer month of April and has truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker,' Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian said.

Poll position: Furious 7, starring the late Paul Walker, right, won the box office crown for the third week running, taking an estimated $29.1 million over the weekend

Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 came in a close second with an estimated $24 million. While the PG-rated comedy didn't perform as well as the first film's $31.8 million opening in 2009, it did surpass Sony's modest expectations. Also, it only cost $30 million to produce.

'It's a great result. It's going to be very profitable for us and a big success,' Sony's President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer said.

'It was something that Kevin really wanted to do and we wanted to do it with him,' he said. 'Kudos to Kevin for working so hard in promoting the film.'

Dergarabedian said 'Blart's' opening 'proves that if you give the people what they want, you can make a tidy profit.'

Meanwhile, the low-budget, social media themed thriller Unfriended took third place with $16 million — sixteen times its production budget.

Around 200,000 people were deported to the Nazi camp in northern Germany during World War Two . British soldiers took over the camp on April 15 , 1945 and found tens of thousands of dead bodies . Their intervention came just two months after diarist Anne Frank , who was held at the camp , died .
-----------------------------------------------
Holocaust survivors have gathered at the site of the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to commemorate the anniversary of its liberation.

More than 72,000 camp inmates and prisoners of war died at the Nazi camp including diarist Anne Frank and her older sister Margot.

British soldiers liberated the camp on April 15, 1945. Today, seventy years on, hundreds of people sobbed as they laid flowers and flags as memorials.

Survivor Marie Vaislic from France sits on a mass grave reading '1000 dead rest here' after the ceremony. It was held to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany

Officials also attended the ceremony including Joachim Gauck, the German president, who said the British soldiers were 'ambassadors of a democratic culture who were not looking for revenge'.

He added: 'We commit ourselves to the obligation of never denying these crimes and of preserving the memories of the victims.'

Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, also attended the memorial. 

He told an audience: 'Right now, we stand on one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the world. But there are no gravestones, there are no markers.

Joachim Gauck, the German president pictured (above) during the ceremony, said the British soldiers who liberated the camp were 'ambassadors of a democratic culture'

'The victims buried here lost not just their lives; the Nazis took their identities as well.'

Lauder also warned that anti-Semitism is on the rise again in Europe, 70 years after the end of the Holocaust.

'Today, 70 years after this camp was liberated, we hear the same anti-Semitic lies.

'Today, a Jewish boy wearing a yarmulke cannot walk down the street in Paris or London or Copenhagen without fearing for his life.'

Anne Frank's diary recounts how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War. It became a bestseller when it was published at the end of the war.

The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house. They were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister died.

After the war the Dutch government set the official date of Anne's death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March.

But some accounts suggest that she might have died in the middle of February - just two months before British soldiers liberated the camp. 

It is likely she caught typhus, which was rife in the overcrowded camp. Her sister Margot also passed away and experts think she too had the disease.  

Their grave, which reads Margot Frank 1926 - 1945 and Anne Frank 1929 - 1945, is a poignant memorial that still stands where the Nazi camp used to be.

Red and white roses, yellow tulips and stones were laid carefully around the grave earlier today.

British soldiers freed around 60,000 prisoners but discovered tens of thousands of bodies of people who had died from extreme overcrowding, disease and starvation.

Typhus, which Miss Frank is thought to have died from, was particularly rife. 

Ceremonies have been held across Germany and Poland throughout the spring marking the advance of Allied troops as Nazi Germany neared defeat. 

They are even more poignant this year because of the dwindling number of survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust, the murder of six million Jews by the regime of Adolf Hitler.

Ceremonies were also taking place today at the former Flossenbürg camp in southern Germany, where around 30,000 people died between 1938 and 1945.

Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande visited  the former Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp during a service to mark the French National Deportation Day in Natzweiler, eastern France.

Real Madrid beat Granada 9-1 , with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring five goals . The Portuguese forward now has 36 goals this season in La Liga . That league tally is more than the totals for 53 of Europe 's top 98 teams . Nine teams in the Barclays Premier League have fewer goals this season .
-----------------------------------------------
Reports of Cristiano Ronaldo's decline have been greatly exaggerated: The Real Madrid forward scored five goals against Granada, taking his tally in La Liga to 36 for the season - more than half of Europe's top teams.

Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career.

His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36

Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1

The Portuguese star now has more goals than 53 teams in Europe's top leagues, including nine in England

There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are:

Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City.

Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of.

And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille.

The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that.

Ronaldo's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille

It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards

Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo

Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman

While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years.

It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.'

If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. 

Premier League: Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Leicester City.

La Liga: Malaga, Athletic Bilbao, Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad, Celta Vigo, Espanyol, Getafe, Levante, Eibar, Elche, Deportivo la Coruna, Almeria, Granada, Cordoba.

Daniel Sturridge appeared in a promotional video for BT Sport . He was joined by comedian Darren Farley , who impersonated Michael Owen . Farley 's impression of the former Reds striker left Sturridge giggling . Liverpool take on Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday .
-----------------------------------------------
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was left in stitches by an impersonation of club legend Michael Owen.  

Ahead of the Reds' FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, the England international met up with comedian Darren Farley as part of an exclusive promotional video to showcase the TV coverage of the match by BT Sport. 

Farley, who first rose to prominence on YouTube, specialises in mimicking a number of Anfield stars both past and present.  

Daniel Sturridge cannot stop laughing after hearing Darren Farley's impression of Michael Owen

Owen, now a BT Sport pundit, played for Liverpool between 1996 and 2004, scoring 118 league goals

His hauntingly accurate of portrayal of Owen was certainly one of his best performances and had Sturridge gasping for breath. 

Between the giggles, the pair discussed the fascinating clash with Villa and Sturridge's trademark goal celebration dance. 

However, while Farley's Owen impression was certainly on point, his dancing left a lot to be desired. 

Sturridge is a major doubt to feature in the game with Villa, facing a late battle to overcome a hip injury. 

Villa, meanwhile, have their own concerns with winger Gabriel Agbonlahor rated 'touch and go' in relation to a hamstring strain, while midfielder Carlos Sanchez is suspended. 

The other FA Cup semi-final will be played between Arsenal and Reading on Saturday.

Concierge service Bluefish are offering dives to journey to the magnificent ship on the Atlantic floor . The unique experience will let you see the famous grand staircase along with many other rooms and areas . The dives form part of valuable research , with data being relayed to scientists worldwide . So far 40 people have done the service compared to over 500 people visiting space .
-----------------------------------------------
It is perhaps the most iconic ship of all time, but the closest most people will get to the Titanic is a visit to the museum in Belfast, or a viewing of the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet blockbuster.

Not so for those with endless funds. One company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. 

The tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase, the ship's huge anchors and the Marconi Room, from which the world's very first SOS was broadcast.

The once-in-a-lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service, Bluefish, and does not come cheap, setting you back a whopping £41,000 ($60,000).

Unique experience: Travel to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the wreck of the Titanic with concierge service Bluefish

Haunting: Beams of light illuminate the features of the tragic ship, which sank on April 14, 1912

A port side forward expansion joint on the boat deck of the bow section of the shipwreck. Travellers will learn about the ship in a series of lectures in addition to the dive

The hefty price may seem like a lot but more than 40 people have so far booked the trip to the Atlantic Ocean depths.

Director of Bluefish, Steve Sims said: 'We have sent over 40 people down and they have been housewives to technology billionaires, the Titanic really does capture the minds of a wide crowd.

'Bluefish is known for providing the amazing and rare and the Titanic fits both those criteria.

'More people have been into space than set eyes on the Titanic.' 

Guests will stay aboard the Akademik Keldysh ship at sea and wait for suitable conditions to see the Titanic up close. 

The transport to the ocean floor is a MIR I or II submersible which are capable of reaching ocean depths of 20,000 ft (98 per cent of the ocean floor worldwide) and withstanding intense pressure.

The submersible is constructed of nickel steel and can hold one pilot and two passengers, providing a personal encounter of the vessel. 

The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship. 

As well as this divers can spot harrowing personal items such as shoes or bags caught between the metal rust, which serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic human loss.

The wreck of the Titanic is situated around 676 kilometres from Newfoundland, almost four kilometres below the surface

Not only does the trip offer a truly unique ocean expedition, but it also offers the chance to learn about the majestic vessel in depth. 

You will take part in a series of lectures and briefings, revealing latest findings about the 269 metre-long liner. 

There will also be a ceremony commemorating the tragic events and remembering all those who lost their lives on April 14, 1912. 

Meals, accommodation and personal video are also included in the somewhat hefty price tag. 

The RV Keldysh and MIRs have made over 15 expeditions to the site of the wreck and have made over a hundred dives.

The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship

Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! More people have been to space than have explored the Titanic, and the dives aim to collect data for scientific experiments 

The aim of the dives is not just tourism, but also obtaining imagery from the site, data and physical samples from the wreck to further research and be used in ongoing scientific experiments being conducted by worldwide scientists 

Since Deep Ocean Expeditions began dives to the wreck in 1998 no artefacts have been removed from the site 

However it hasn't been plain sailing for Bluefish trips to see the famous ship. Only eight people took the voyage between 2002 and 2006 and after the recession put a strain on luxury spending. 

'The recession hit and everything went to pot,' Simms told CNN Money.

After years of fruitless searching by many organisations the wreck of the RMS Titanic was found by Dr Robert Ballard in 1986. Since that time multiple dives have been conducted by some of the world’s five deep diving submersibles, representing France, USA and Russia

Now the service has picked back up and guests can experience the whole package, or opt to have everything apart from the dive to the wreck, for £6,820 ($10,000). 

The bespoke concierge service offers a range of elaborate services, besides the Titanic expedition. 

Whether it is racing half a million dollars Mercedes in the Mojave Desert, a Virgin Galactic flight into space, or having a James Bond experience in Monaco with Bond girls and being rescued by American Navy Seals, Simms sees no challenge as impossible for the right clients.

The luxury does not come cheap, with membership to the club being £3,414 ($5,000) per annum before you have forked out for any experience.  

Star-crossed lovers! Many were captivated by the James Cameron film, released in 1997, which saw the affluent Rose (played by Kate Winslet) fall in love with poor Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) on the Titanic's fateful voyage

An Amnesty International report calls for attacks on women 's rights activists in Afghanistan to be investigated . The report examines the persecution of activists not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords , but also by government officials . Some activists continue their work despite their lives being at risk .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)An Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan.

The report, entitled "Their Lives on the Line," examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials.

Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world.

Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence.

But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets.

In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard.

In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20% from the previous year, although the number of civilian victims had decreased, said Amnesty in the report.

The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Afghanistan at the time, Jan Kubis, told the U.N. Security Council that "the majority (of women killed) is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country.

"Women activists have been deliberately targeted."

And according to the human rights group, little support has come from those in power.

"The Afghan government has done very little to protect them," Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, Horia Mosadiq, tells CNN. "Perpetrators almost always walk free, and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored.

"Many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities, it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded."

During the attack on Farkhunda, "many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed," says Mosadiq. Twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack, but she argues that this is insufficient.

"Suspending police officers is not enough, those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence."

But what is striking is the resilience of the activists, who continue their work despite their lives being on the line.

"It was a remarkable moment," says Mosadiq, recalling the female protesters at Farkhunda's funeral. "Unlike anything I have seen in my decades of campaigning for women's rights in our country."

Selay Ghaffer, 32, is a women's rights activist and spokesperson for the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in Kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy, social justice and women's rights.

The party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing Afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice.

Taking part in Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death, she tells CNN that despite the onslaught of violence against Afghan women over the years, this was the worst case.

But the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message.

"So the women of Afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore... And we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women," said Ghaffer.

"So this is why we decided to carry the dead body of Farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that (a) man has to do this job."

Surprisingly, she says that male onlookers supported their mission, although they are in the minority overall in the country. "Men (at the funeral), they said you have to do this, because this is how you can change the hatred in Afghanistan.

"Without men, it is not possible for women to get their rights," she says. "So these men and women were working together. But at the same time, women need to step forward for their rights."

Mosadiq says the fight for women's rights was established a while ago.

"Women's activism in Afghanistan is nothing new -- the women's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001, and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains.

"These gains are under threat now, however, and some are even rolled back. It's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen."

Ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work, received through emails and phone calls, at her home and office. But she says she knew what she was getting herself into.

"I knew it wasn't an easy task. There might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights.

"As a woman, I want to struggle more (for my rights), I want to have more people around me, to struggle with me."

Mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution, although the response to Farkhunda's killing, from both men and women, has been a "silver lining."

Ghaffer, however, believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving.

Interestingly, it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight. "I must say strongly that it was my father (who inspired me), who is not any more with me, because he... died three months ago," she says.

"He always told me that women always suffered in this country," she says, her voice overcome with emotion. "And you have to struggle for your rights. Because in this traditional, patriarchal society, nobody will give these rights (to) you."

She realizes how lucky she is, she adds, in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models.

Ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women, not least to the victim of the recent, horrific mob violence. "So if I should not do it, if another sister is not doing it, then who will do it? Who will get the rights for us? We have to struggle for it.

"If we keep our silence, more Farkhundas will be killed in this country."

Raheem Sterling , Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard are Liverpool 's top scorers in the Premier League this season with six goals each . Seventeen of 20 Premier League clubs have top scorers with more goals . Liverpool are paying for failing to properly replace goals of Luis Suarez .
-----------------------------------------------
Twelve months ago, Liverpool were a free-flowing, potent attacking force with the SS (Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of Liverpool's 101 goals in the Premier League.This season, however, the goals have dried up. 

Replacing Suarez was always going to be a near-impossible task, but Liverpool fans would have started the season quietly confident that the quality was there to collectively make up for the Uruguayan's absence. 

Unfortunately for Brendan Rodgers, things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season.  

Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge (right) scored 52 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season

Raheem Sterling has struggled in front of goal this season, scoring only scored six Premier League goals

Jordan Henderson (centre) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season, a penalty against Arsenal on Saturday

With just seven games of the season left Liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard - have scored six goals each.

To put that into context, only Crystal Palace (Dwight Gayle and Mile Jedinak - four) and Sunderland (Adam Johnson and Steven Fletcher - four) have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool. while Aston Villa's top scorers Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor have also only managed six each. 

What the stats clearly show is that Liverpool have not filled the void left by Suarez, they are missing a Harry Kane (19 goals), a Diego Costa (also 19), a Sergio Aguero (17), even a Charlie Austin (16 goals) - and it has cost them dearly. 

Harry Kane (centre) didn't score against Burnley on Sunday, but has 19 Premier League goals this season

Diego Costa is the joint top scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals in his first season in England

Liverpool fans would argue that in Sturridge, who scored 21 league goals last term, they do have a player capable of scoring 20+ goals a season - and they are right. The England striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries, and that is unfortunate, but Liverpool's others goal threats - Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert - simply haven't met the standards set by the SS last season. 

Some may also argue that while Liverpool lack a single focal point in attack, the group as a whole have picked up the slack. That may be true to an extent but Kane and Costa have scored more than Sterling, Henderson and Gerrard combined. 

And there can be little doubt that had Sturridge remained fit all season he would have more than six Premier League goals by this stage of the season.  

The are mitigating circumstances for Liverpool, no doubt, but the stats don't lie and the fact that no one person has grabbed the mantle left by Suarez or Sturridge has proven costly for Liverpool - and may be a crucial reason why they miss out on Champions League football next season. 

Only Sunderland and Crystal Palace have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool this season.

-----------------------------------------------
An associate dean of students at the University of Virginia said Wednesday a widely discredited Rolling Stone article caused her professional and personal harm by portraying her as insensitive and unresponsive to an alleged victim of a gang rape.

Nicole P. Eramo said in an open letter Wednesday to the magazine's publisher, Jann S. Wenner, that the magazine has not done enough to make amends.

'Rolling Stone has deeply damaged me both personally and professionally,' Eramo wrote. 'Using me as the personification of a heartless administration, the Rolling Stone article attacked my life's work.'

Scroll down to read full letter... 

Hitting back: U.Va. dean Nicole P. Eramo blasted Rolling Stone in an open letter on Wednesday over its retracted campus rape story

The magazine furthered its 'malicious and false allegations by accompanying the article with a cartoonish picture of me doctored to appear as though I was smiling and giving a "thumbs up" to a crying victim,' Eramo writes.

The magazine retracted an article about sexual violence at U.Va. after the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism issued a scathing report this month concluding Rolling Stone had failed to meet journalistic standards. 

The magazine pledged to review its practices and removed 'A Rape on Campus' from its website. Wenner said he won't fire anyone.

The Charlottesville police department has said it had found no evidence to back the claims of the victim identified in the story only as 'Jackie,' who said she was raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house.

Not enough? Eramo said the article falsely said she tried to discourage victim 'Jackie' (left) from reporting or discussing the alleged assault. The article's author, Sabrina Rubin Erdely (right), has previously apologized, saying she would not repeat the same mistakes but has not been fired

Eramo said the article falsely said she tried to discourage Jackie from reporting or discussing the alleged assault. Eramo said she in fact 'arranged for Jackie to meet with detectives almost immediately after she provided information' about being victimized at the fraternity house.

The fallout from the article's false portrayal has included emails 'expressing that hope that I be killed or raped, and commenting on that they hoped that I had a daughter so that she could be raped,' she wrote.

A Japanese court has rejected a petition by residents to delay the reactivation of reactors in the country 's southwest . The reopening of two other nuclear reactors in Fukui was recently blocked by a Japanese court over safety fears . Japan 's 48 nuclear reactors have been offline in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster .
-----------------------------------------------
Tokyo (CNN)A week after a Japanese court issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in a western prefecture, a different court has rejected a petition by residents to delay the reactivation of reactors in the country's southwest.

Kagoshima District Court found no "irrationalities" in new safety standards set out by the government in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima meltdowns, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.

By dismissing resident's demands, the court ruled that the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima could restart. The first of two reactors is scheduled to go back online in July.

The ruling could provide a fillip to the government's plans to bring Japanese nuclear reactors back into operation, more than four years since the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused the failure at TEPCO's Fukushima plant.

The original court ruling, which affects the Takahama plant in Fukui Prefecture, cited safety concerns as the reason for the injunction, a court official told CNN.

Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's plant.

But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake.

Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant.

Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports.

But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart.

Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy.

"That was a body blow (for Abe) because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics," he said.

"It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it."

Anti-nuclear activists celebrated following the Fukui District Court's decision in their favor Tuesday.

The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster.

It said in a statement that "scientific and professional findings" showed that the safety of the reactors was assured.

But the court ruled that the new safety standards were "loose," lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said.

The power company said it would appeal the decision. "We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and cannot accept it at all," it said in a statement.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the "world's strictest" safety standards.

The government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart, he said.

Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations.

Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court.

Analyst Henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the Takahama decision, as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives.

Prior to the Fukushima disaster, about 30% of Japan's energy was nuclear generated.

CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report from Tokyo.

Alondra Luna Nunez 's case drew international attention after a video of her being forced into a police vehicle last week appeared online . There was no immediate explanation of why authorities did not confirm her identity before sending her out of the country . The Foreign Ministry said Mexican officials were carrying out a court order to send Alondra to Dorotea Garcia , a Houston woman .
-----------------------------------------------
This is the horrifying moment a 14-year-old Mexican girl was torn away from her family by federal police and sent to live with a Houston woman who mistakenly thought she was her long-lost daughter. 

Alondra Luna Nunez can be seen screaming and fighting with every ounce of her energy as she is dragged out of her school in front of her mother in Guanajuato in central Mexico last week. She pleaded with the officers, who were working for Interpol, not to take her from her parents.

Alondra is now back with her real family after a DNA test proved that she was not the daughter of Houston resident Dorotea Garcia.

'They stole my daughter,' her real mother, Susana Nunez, raged to Milenio Television on Wednesday. 'I didn't know this woman existed.'

Alondra used every ounce of her energy to fight Mexican federal police officers, who were working for Interpol on the orders of a Texas judge.

Garcia says she found Alondra after she traveled to Mexico in search of her daughter who was illegally taken from Texas by her father in 2007 at age four.

Garcia convinced authorities that Alondra was her daughter, despite her family's pleas and the fact that they produced a birth certificate, baptismal documents and family photographs of Alondra as a small child.

Alondra was torn away from her parents and little brother by police who were acting on the orders of a judge from Texas. 

She was taken to the neighboring state of Michoacan for a hearing on April 12. A judge there ignored her family's pleas - and the evidence - that Alondra belonged to them and not Garcia from Texas.

In the end, the Mexican judge ruled in Garcia's favor based on a car on the bridge of Alondra's nose. Garcia claimed her daughter had a scar above her eyebrow.

Dorotea Garcia (pictured) believed that Alondra Nunez was her long-lost daughter Alondra, who was taken to Mexico by her father in 2007

The girl and Garcia went by bus to Houston, where Alondra later recorded a video, posted to social media, in which she looked calm and happy and told her parents in Mexico not to worry as they waited for results of a DNA test there.

'I'm fine. I see that the United States is nice,' she said, adding, 'I don't understand anything they're saying, because everything is in English.'

On Wednesday, after being returned to her parents, Alondra spoke to reporters in her hometown of Guanajuato and said she was happy to be home. She said the video recorded in Houston was intended to assure her parents she was OK, even though she really wasn't.

'She took me from my parents,' Alondra said. 'I didn't know her or Mr. Reynaldo,' she added, referring to the father of Garcia's missing daughter.

The Foreign Ministry said Mexican officials were carrying out a court order to send Alondra to Dorotea Garcia, a Houston woman. Garcia claimed the girl was her daughter who had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father

Similarities? Dorotea never stopped looking for her daughter Alondra Diaz Garcia - seen here before she was taken as (right) in a digitally aged picture

A judge ignored her parents' pleas and put Alondra on a bus to Houston, Texas, with Dorotea Garcia last week

It was unclear how the girl came to be identified as Garcia's daughter.

In 2007, the Foreign Ministry received a claim stating that Garcia's then 4-year-old daughter, Alondra Diaz Garcia, had been taken by her father from the U.S. and was believed to be in Michoacan. This year, Garcia went to Mexico and said she had found her daughter in Guanajuato, prompting U.S. authorities to seek the help of Interpol in retrieving her.

Meanwhile, Alondra Diaz Garcia remains missing. Reynaldo Diaz is suspected of abducting her from Houston in 2007, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A U.S. felony warrant has been issued for his arrest.

Alondra Luna's uncle, Ruben Nunez, said that she returned in good condition and that the family is sure to seek some kind of legal damages.

'In whatever form, they will try to sue whoever is found to be responsible,' Nunez told reporters in the airport in Leon, Mexico, after the girl's arrival. 'It's not right what they did - take the girl just because they could.'

Students stampeded ; some jumped from a fifth story at a dorm ; one student died , school officials say . The blasts were caused by faulty electrical cable , and Kenya Power is at the school . The panic came less than two weeks after terrorists attacked Kenya 's Garissa University .
-----------------------------------------------
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)University of Nairobi students were terrified Sunday morning when they heard explosions -- caused by a faulty electrical cable -- and believed it was a terror attack, the school said.

Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school.

The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists.

On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said.

Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said.

Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said.

"As we mourn the unfortunate loss of the departed student, we are also praying for the quick recovery of those who were injured," said Vice Chancellor Peter M.F. Mbithi in a statement.

He called on the students, staff and public to remain calm.

CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi and Ashley Fantz wrote this story in Atlanta.

The Dadaab refugee camp is the world 's largest , with more than 600,000 people . Kenya will change `` the way America changed after 9/11 , '' deputy president says . William Ruto adds that `` we must secure this country at whatever cost ''
-----------------------------------------------
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday gave the United Nations' refugee agency three months to relocate refugees from the Dadaab camp -- the world's largest -- to Somalia, or "we shall relocate them ourselves."

"The way America changed after 9/11 is the way Kenya will change after Garissa," Ruto said in Nyeri, according to a statement from his office.

Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in eastern Kenya this month, killing 147 people. Kenya's government says that attack was masterminded by senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, whose "extensive terrorist network within Kenya" extends into the sprawling Dadaab complex, according to a Kenyan government document given to CNN.

Students wake to Islamist militants' terror

Ruto, who is the second highest-ranking person in Kenya's government behind President Uhuru Kenyatta, said his government has had discussions with United Nations officials about what to do with the camp.

On Saturday, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees officer said the agency had not received any formal request from Kenya's government about moving Dadaab. The U.N. refugee agency manages the Dadaab complex, having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid Somalia's civil war.

The agency and the governments of both Kenya and Somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of Somali refugees. But that was supposed to be mutually agreed-upon and voluntary, in accordance with the refugees' "freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions" where they'd end up, according to the pact.

None of those things, it seems, applies now to the move pushed by Ruto on Saturday. It's not clear where he expects the refugees to go, other than somewhere into Somalia and out of Kenya.

Any mass move would be a monumental task, disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 Somalis who call the camp their home. Simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex, which has seen devastating droughts, contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help.

Still, as tough as conditions there are, they are seen as a better alternative to life back in Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based and has carried out violent attacks for years.

Yet the Islamist extremist group hasn't confined its terror to its homeland, as illustrated by the Garissa attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, which ended with at least 67 dead.

The Dadaab complex came under government scrutiny after the Westgate Mall attack, too. But just a few weeks later, CNN's Nima Elbagir managed to go from Somalia to the Dadaab refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya, or "rat routes," just like many others have done, Al-Shabaab sympathizers among them.

Such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers' willful ignorance of migrants' fake IDs, as acknowledged by then-Interior Minister Ole Lemku, illustrates Kenya's challenge in keeping out threats from Somalia.

That's why, in addition to moving the Dadaab camp, Kenya is building of a 435-mile (700-kilometer) wall covering most of the Somali border from Mandera to Kiunga -- a wall that Ruto says has begun to prevent Al-Shabaab elements from getting into Kenya. The deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down.

These measures are in addition to Kenyan airstrikes on Al-Shabaab camps in Somalia in the days after the Garissa massacre.

"We must secure this country at whatever cost, even if we lose business with Somalia," Ruto said Saturday. "No politics, no games, no half-measures should apply, as the death of the 147 students must touch all Kenyans."

CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta.

U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe : Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon-free electricity . So why does n't the President 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing carbon emissions , do more with nuclear power ?
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)If there was ever any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy.

Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity.   Surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing the United States' overall carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. Well, think again.

James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in 2013 that "continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."

Yet Wednesday, the White House will celebrate Earth Day and promote its work to fend off climate change, while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists.

Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it.  This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation.  EPA's modeling is divorced from reality.

First, EPA's "Base Case for the Proposed Clean Power Plan" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the Clean Power Plan.  This base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050.

EPA's implementation modeling, "Option 1 -- State,"  shows exactly the same situation: no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050.  In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050.

These assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets. A group of University of Tennessee graduate students made this point to EPA at a public hearing last summer.

Using EPA's own data, the graduate students showed that EPA's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants.  The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase.

President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model.

For example, when EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill in 2008, the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation.

Where did this policy shift come from?

At a recent hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's California Global Warming Solutions Act when developing its so-called Clean Power Plan and that EPA's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free.

Thus, EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others.

Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they have hidden them in the modeling.

For example, the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050.  This is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement.

This anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order "Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade," which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions. Even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors.

While I have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security, and I have supported legislation that helps to clean the air. The administration says it shares these same interests, despite differing avenues to get there.  The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key.

But the Clean Power Plan and the President's recent executive order demonstrate that the Obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy.

If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.

-----------------------------------------------
A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look.

Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil.

Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon.

Scroll down for videos 

Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend

Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched

Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery.

In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice.

'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 

'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' 

Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched.

Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview.

She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy.

'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought "you're not gay, you're transgender."'

Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above)

That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin

Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005.

'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 

'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction.

'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' 

And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris.

'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said.

'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.'

The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 

'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 

'But then the nightmare started.'

'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections.

Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat

She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.'

She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free.

Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.'

She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' 

As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.

A Chinese millionaire has splurged on a vast 217 hectare New Zealand island which she refers to as her 'toy.'

The buyer, Wendy Wei Mei Wu, is reportedly yet to decide what she wants to do with Slipper Island, which is located 4 km off the coast of the New Zealand's North Island.

The 2.7 km long, 1.8 km wide landmass is a 15 minute ferry ride from North Island. It boasts two airstrips and six houses, all with nearby beaches and sweeping ocean views.

The NZ $7.5 million (AUD $6.765 million) sale has divided the family who own the island, with some of them claiming it represents' the loss of the family's legacy', reports Stuff NZ.

Slipper Island, a 2.7 km long, 1.8 km wide landmass located 4 km off the coast of the New Zealand's North Island, has been purchased for AUD $6.75 million

The 217 hectare island was purchased by former property developer Wendy Wei Mei Wu 

Ms Wu lists her occupation online as 'housewife,' but she is otherwise shrouded in mystery and was referred to by NZ Herald as 'publicity shy.'

A former property developer, Ms Wu made headlines in 2010 for making the biggest private home sale of the year, the $NZ 15 million Fairholm Mansion in the affluent Auckland suburb of Remuera.

Her daughter Vivienne Zhuo has assisted with negotiations for the purchase, and said her mother 'just loves the island' and 'it's a toy for her, ' though they're undecided on future plans for the island.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Zhuo, but she declined to comment on future plans for the island.

The island is currently used by day-trippers and school camp users, and the cabins can be rented from between $250-$750 a night

The sale has divided the Needham family who own the island, with some of them claiming it represents' the loss of the family's legacy'

Slipper Island is currently used by day-trippers and school camp users, and the cabins can be rented from between $250-$750 a night.

It has been owned by the Needham family for 45 years. There are 13 siblings in the family, many of whom are shareholders in the island.

While the islands biggest shareholder-Liz Needham- is in favour of the sale, it was reported that other shareholders, who chose not to be named, were devastated to be losing 'the family legacy' where some of family members ashes lay.

It's believed the sale has also saddened local Maori tribes, who are concerned about the conservation of several historic sites on the island.

`` I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret , '' Robert Bates tells `` Today '' He says he did n't mean to kill Eric Harris and rejects claims his training records were forged . `` I still ca n't believe it happened , '' Bates tells the NBC show .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Robert Bates says he gets it, how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun.

Bates -- the Tulsa County, Oklahoma, reserve sheriff's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told NBC's "Today" show Friday that he used to think that, too.

"Believe me," he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the April 2 death of Eric Harris, "it can happen to anyone."

Harris died after Bates shot him -- accidentally, he says -- after calling out "Taser! Taser!" in a tussle captured on a police body camera.

Bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun.

How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser?

While Bates is at the center of the maelstrom over Harris' death, he isn't the only one under scrutiny.

The Oklahoma NAACP wants charges against other officers involved in Harris' death, and a state and federal investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office's treatment of minorities. The sheriff's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge Bates' training records.

In his interview Friday with "Today," Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies.

"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing," he told the show.

And on Thursday, a sheriff's office official denied to the Tulsa World newspaper that any records had ever been forged.

As an advanced reserve deputy, sheriff's office policy calls for Bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program, according to the Tulsa World.

Bates would also have needed firearms certification training.

Officials have yet to locate records showing what training Bates completed, said Maj. Shannon Clark of the sheriff's office.

But Clark did say it's possible that some training requirements may have been waived.

Sheriff Stanley Glanz has the authority to waive any department policies, Clark said.

"The policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff, but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization. That's part of being a sheriff's office," Clark told the newspaper.

Glanz told KFAQ radio this week that officials can't find records of Bates' firearms certification.

The instructor who provided that training is now a U.S. Secret Service agent, and officials haven't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in, Glanz told the station.

Other discrepancies have surfaced about training that Bates claims to have attended, including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction.

Tulsa World reporter Dylan Goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that Bates' records had been falsified.

The newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why.

But the orders apparently started years ago, "back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy," reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's "New Day."

Bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to Glanz's re-election campaign, leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop.

He rejected that claim in the "Today" interview as "unbelievably unfair."

Bates' attorney, Clark Brewster, also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded.

He said those making the accusations include fired sheriff's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents Harris' family.

"His training is extensive and certainly adequate," Brewster told CNN on Thursday.

Bates appeared on the "Today" show with his wife, two daughters and Brewster. He seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened.

"I can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days," Bates said. "I'm not at all sure it's not still with me today. Lack of sleep, inability to concentrate, all of those plus more. You know, I still can't believe it happened."

In describing the events leading up to Harris' death, Bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch Harris in the act of illegally selling a gun.

Bates said he had participated in "several hundred" such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and "clean up" after deputies, taking photos and notes.

But as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale, Harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward Bates' position.

As deputies were trying to subdue Harris, Bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control.

"I yelled, 'Taser! Taser!' as required in training. The deputy below me ducked, he pulled away from it so that I could," Bates said.

"The laser light is the same on each weapon. I saw the light and I squeezed the trigger," Bates told "Today."

The result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun. Instead, it was a gunshot.

"I shot him! I'm sorry!" Bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident.

Bates apologized to Harris' family, who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs.

Harris' brother, Andre Harris, said this week that he didn't think the shooting was racially motivated. Instead, he said, "This is simply evil."

But Bates,who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, said he didn't mean to kill Harris. His attorney has called it an "excusable homicide."

"I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret," said Bates, who is free on $25,000 bail.

Real Madrid host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals . The two sides drew 0-0 in the first leg at the Vicente Calderon last week . Real have not beaten Atletico since last season 's Champions League final . Diego Simeone 's men have won four of their seven meetings this season .
-----------------------------------------------
Real Madrid's last win against Atletico Madrid came in the Champions League final less than a year ago, but in the time since that memorable night in Lisbon Carlo Ancelotti's side have failed to win any of their last seven games against their city rivals.

Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final second leg will be the eighth time the two teams have met since last season's final, with Diego Simeone's men emerging victorious on four occasions over the previous eight months.

Real needed a late equaliser from Sergio Ramos and extra-time to beat Atleti at Benfica's Estadio da Luz in May last year but Los Rojiblancos have gained a measure of revenge since.

Real Madrid have not beaten rivals Atletico since victory in Lisbon, losing four games and drawing three

Real Madrid wins - 0

Atletico Madrid wins - 4

Draws - 3

Real Madrid goals - 4

Atletico Madrid goals - 12

Atletico's dominance began with victory in the Spanish Super Cup, a two-legged tie played between the winners of La Liga and the Copa del Rey.

A late equaliser from Raul Garcia cancelled out James Rodriguez's opener at the Bernabeu before Mario Manduzkic netted the only goal of the game at the Vicente Calderon to seal a 2-1 win on aggregate.

Less than a month later and Simeone's men were at it again, this time defeating Los Blancos in their own backyard in La Liga.

A penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo got the hosts level after Tiago's early header but Arda Turan popped up in the 76th minute to sweep the ball past Iker Casillas and secure a 2-1 triumph.

Atletico's third win against Real this season arrived in January when the two sides met in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey.

With the first leg on home soil, Fernando Torres made a winning return to his boyhood club as he helped the hosts earn a 2-0 win courtesy of goals from Garcia and Jose Maria Gimenez.

Atleti finished the job at the Bernabeu with goals in the first minute of each half from Torres helping them to a 2-2 draw on the night and 4-2 victory on aggregate.

Real's most humiliating result in their seven-game winless streak arrived at the Vicente Calderon on February 7 as Gareth Bale and Co suffered their heaviest defeat in over four years.

Goals from Tiago, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic earned the reigning champions a 4-0 win to maintain their hopes of a second consecutive title.

The two sides played out a goalless draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final last week, with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak widely praised for denying Real a crucial away goal.

The couple are known to be incredibly passionate about health and fitness . Jessa 's older sister Jill , who gave birth earlier this month , remained very active throughout her pregnancy .
-----------------------------------------------
19 Kids and Counting stars Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald are both known for being incredibly fitness- and health-conscious, and now that they are expecting their first child, they have to adapt their lifestyle.

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the the news of their pregnancy ina video for TLC.com, which featured them both making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting.

Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records.

Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child

Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary

'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.'

The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars’ hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple’s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. 

A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'.

Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram.

Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside

Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty'

As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn’t been the case. 

'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them.

'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!'

However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons.   

70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor 

Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c)

Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' 

The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. 

Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.

Andy Murray and long-time girlfriend Kim Sears will tie the knot in the Scottish town of Dunblane on Saturday . The British No 1 and his partner met when they were teenagers at the US Open in New York in 2005 . Murray and Sears confirmed their engagement last November after more than nine years together .
-----------------------------------------------
The wedding of the year in Scotland takes place on Saturday when British No 1 and two-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray marries Kim Sears, his girlfriend of almost 10 years, in his hometown of Dunblane.

Murray and Sears, both aged 27, met when the pair were teenagers during the US Open in 2005. Murray was playing in only his second Grand Slam tournament, while Sears was travelling with her tennis coach father Nigel.

The couple got back together in 2010 following a brief split and after having to field constant questions over the years on when he would propose, their engagement was confirmed last November.

Kalman Kallai travelled from Borden , Ontario to Comox , British Columbia . He brought the green rocking chair to make his journey more interesting . Along the way the traveller was accompanied by friends and his father . The journey took nine days to complete and 4500 km of land was covered .
-----------------------------------------------
A Canadian man found a novel way to take in the sights while travelling across country, by taking an rocking chair with him.

Kalman Kallai enjoyed the spectacular Canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes.

Calculating that the drive would take him across a colossal 2,796 miles (4500km) of land, Mr Kallai believed that his journey would be more interesting if he used it as an opportunity to see more of his country.

The traveller sits before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hand

Mr Kallai and a friend mimic the planes that fly past at the beginning of the traveller's adventure

After picking up a green rocking chair that he acquired for free from online advertisement site Kijiji, the traveller attached his trailer and set off on the nine-day journey.

The video begins with Mr Kallai carrying his chair to a wooded area, before placing it down and taking a seat.

He wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat – clothing items that remain a running theme throughout the course of the video.

He momentarily leaves the chair to chase some birds on a beach before making his way through a field and waving at some cows.

Later in the video the traveller is met by his dad, who humorously steals the rocking chair before he is swiftly removed.

Continuing a good portion of the journey together, the pair dance and jump around in front of rapids and tease a number of large statues.

Creature comfort! Mr Kallai makes a number of hand gestures in the video and even waves at cows

Despite hauling the rocking chair around in a trailer, the traveller is also featured carrying it on his head

Mr Kallai said: ‘I brought my dad with me for part of the trek. It was a great bonding experience, as we shared many laughs.

‘I heard some pretty interesting stories about his youth that I hadn't heard before, especially since my mother wasn't on the trip with us.’

The pair reach Manitoba together before they meet with some people and the traveller’s father leaves his son to journey on by himself.

Arriving in Alberta the temperature suddenly plummets and a lot more snow features in the following images.

Eventually however, Mr Kallai reaches British Colombia and the video concludes with him carrying his rocking chair into what appears to be his new front room and taking a seat.

50 per cent of Australians surveyed said they 'd like to work for Virgin . It beat Qantas , which was in fifth place , as the most desired company . Coming second in the survey was national public broadcaster the ABC . But four jobs in the top ten list were in government departments .
-----------------------------------------------
The glamour of a jet setting lifestyle has made working for Virgin airlines the most desired job in Australia.

But a survey of workers has also revealed working for government departments - long considered an easy ride - are among the jobs people would most like to have.

The Department of Immigration ranked third in the survey, while the Department of Defence and the Department of Health were also named in the top ten places Australians would like to work. 

Virgin, the second-largest airline in the country, was reportedly handed the accolade for its ‘pleasant working atmosphere, a good work-life balance and strong management’.  

Richard Branson's Virgin Airline is the place most Australians want to work for, according to a new survey

Desk jobs in government departments highly ranked in Australia’s Most Attractive Employer awards

More than 50 per cent of participants in a study of 12,000 appeared to want to work for boss Richard Branson. 

Coming second in the survey of Australia’s Most Attractive Employer is national public broadcaster the ABC – confirming a TV career is still high on the list of many people’s dream jobs. 

And named in third place Thursday was the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, headed up by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. 

Other Australians named the ABC as the place they would most like to work, alongside journalist Leigh Sales

Fourth and fifth place at the Randstad Awards were also airline and TV jobs, with the Seven Network and Qantas named respectively.

People were asked which companies they had heard of, just how much they would like to work there and why they would like to work there. 

Frank Ribuot, CEO of Randstad Australia, said: ‘The Virgin brand is widely recognised around the world and by people from all walks of life. 

The Department of Health came in at number 10 in the survey of where most Australians want to work

The Department of Immigration, headed up by Peter Dutton (right), came third. While other Aussies want to work Samantha Armytage at the Seven Network (left)  

‘For the past few years, Virgin Australia has been recognised as one of the best employers in Australia so it’s testament to the company’s continued investment towards building its employer brand that this year it has taken the highest accolade.’

Geraldine Chin Moody, Group Executive, People, Culture and Sustainability Virgin Australia, said: ‘Our people have been key to the successful transformation of the airline over the past few years, and this award is testament to their outstanding professionalism and dedication to excellence.

‘Our focus is on supporting our team to actively manage their careers and develop to their full potential. Our people get opportunities to be involved in our transformational projects and build their skills internally.’

Qantas was beaten by Virgin Australia as the top place to work but it still came in fifth place in the survey 

In sixth place was multinational food and beverage company Nestle who have headoffice in Rhodes in NSW

In seventh place, Aussies would like a job at Coles or Kmart owners Wesfarmers 

In eleventh place was a career with the Australian Federal Police

The image is believed to come from a firebrand American religious group . Professors of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz said the image is dangerous . The Professor said it represents a broader anti-caesarean sentiment . World Health Organisation said the number of caesareans needs to drop .
-----------------------------------------------
Doctors have condemned a social media campaign which accuses mothers who have a caesarean as being ‘too lazy to have a baby'.

The image, which is believed to come from a firebrand American religious group called 'The Disciples of the New Dawn' in the U.S, has been circulating on mother's groups in Australia.

University of Sydney's Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz told Daily Mail Australia the image represents a broader anti-caesarean sentiment which has harmful consequences for women who should be choosing caesareans for health reasons.

An offensive image circulating social media which endeavours to shame women who have undergone caesareans 

‘They are suggesting that it's the woman's own fault if she need a caesarean. That’s like saying it’s your fault that have an inflamed appendix, or bowel cancer. It’s plain stupid.’

The world-renowned gynaecologist says a drive to reduce the rates of C-sections is forcing obstetricians to 'act against their own better professional judgment.'

‘While it sits on the the extreme end of the caesarean spectrum, it’s an attitude which is actually widespread in Australia. That’s why I feel it needs to be addressed.’

Professor Dietz said the sharp rise in Caesareans since the 1980’s has triggered a strong movement from people trying to curb the rates.

Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births

Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz said the image represents an attitude which is widespread in Australia

‘The reality is that your average newborn is much bigger now than in the past, and for some women Caesareans are the safest option. It’s downright dangerous to deny women that right.’

Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births.

It’s believed the anti-caesarean campaign on social media is a bid to pressure mums to into following the WHO appeal.

There is still no relief for hopeful house-hunters in Sydney as the capital city records yet another record boom in property prices after a 'strong' quarter.

Dwelling values rose by 5.8 per cent in the Harbour city, a record growth and the strongest increase since April in 2009, according to the latest figures from RP Data.

It comes after the Reserve Bank cut official interest rates to 2.25 per cent in February, leading to a weekly 80 per cent auction clearance rate and an investor fuelled market.

Sydney’s dwelling values rose by 5.8 per cent in the last quarter bringing the average median house price to $690,000

It's thus no surprise to see properties across the capital city sell for well over the $1 million mark like this Ryde residence in Sydney’s north west which sold for $1.8 million on the weekend

Set on 565 sqm, the four bedroom property features a deluxe spa bath, two terraces, three bathrooms and a fireplace

'Although household income growth is minimal, Sydney's housing market continues to reach new record highs, with values increasing over the past 35 months,' Tim Lawless, the head of research at CoreLogic RP Data, said.

'It does pose the question of how much longer the growth can persist.'

Sydney's performance drove the quarterly national dwelling value to heighten by 3 per cent, despite Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth suffering significant declines over the quarter.

'Although value growth has started 2015 on a strong note, the annual rate of growth has moderated back to 7.4 per cent, which is the slowest annual growth rate since September 2013,' Mr Lawless said.

This five-bedroom home at 39 Holmes Street, Maroubra in Sydney’s eastern suburbs sold for $2 million on Saturday

Across two levels it features open plan living areas, a chic kitchen with stone benches and three bathrooms with  a stand-alone bath

Sydney's performance drove the quarterly national dwelling value to heighten by 3 per cent, despite Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth suffering significant declines over the quarter

'Despite the headwinds of softer labour markets, very low rental yields, increased oversight on lending conditions and heightened economic uncertainty, historically low mortgage rates appear to be adding further stimulus to the housing market, albeit that stimulus is largely being felt in Sydney.'

The median house price across the combined capital cities is now $530,000, with Sydney being the only city to surpass the figure with a median of $690,000.

Canberra surprisingly performed second best to Sydney over the quarter with a 4.1 per cent increase in dwelling values leading to a $530,000 median house price, followed by Melbourne at 3.5 per cent and $518,000.

The remaining capital cities were all under 1 per cent with Hobart at 0.9 per cent and Darwin at 0.4 per cent. Perth took out the last place at -2.7 per cent despite beating Hobart and Darwin over the year.

This five-bedroom home at 95 Chelmsford Street, Newtown in Sydney’s inner west, sold for $2.3 million on Saturday

Hobart has maintained its position as the most affordable position by a longshot, with a median dwelling price of just $310,000.

Mr Lawless offered a word of caution to investors with their eye on Sydney however, suggesting the market could soon begin to 'lose momentum'.

'There is some risk that recent investors could be left holding a very expensive but low yielding asset with a lower than expected rate of capital gain over the coming years,' he said.

'From there it will be interesting to see if they bide their time in the housing market or exit to other asset classes with a stronger return profile.'

The nightmares from five years as a sex slave of the Japanese army, from 1940 onwards, are still crystal clear. Kim is determined to share her story with anyone who will listen, until she's no longer physically able.

"My only wish is to set the record straight about the past. Before I die," Kim says.

Kim was a 14-year-old girl when the Japanese came to her village in Korea. She says they told her she had no choice but to leave her home and family to support the war effort by working at a sewing factory.

"There was no option not to go," she recalls. "If we didn't go, we'd be considered traitors,"

Instead of going to a sewing factory, Kim says she ended up in Japanese military brothels in half a dozen countries. Along with about 30 other women, she says she was locked in a room and forced to do things no teenage girl -- no woman -- should ever have to do.

Kim describes seemingly endless days of soldiers lined up outside the brothel, called a "comfort station."

Often they were so close to the front lines, they could hear the battles of World War Two happening all around them.

"Our job was to revitalize the soldiers," she says. "On Saturdays, they would start lining up at noon. And it would last until 8pm. There was always a long line of soldiers. On Sunday it was 8 a.m to 5 p.m. Again, a long line. I didn't have the chance to count how many."

Kim estimates each Japanese soldier took around three minutes. They usually kept their boots and leg wraps on, hurriedly finishing so the next solider could have his turn. Kim says it was dehumanizing, exhausting, and often excruciating.

"When it was over, I couldn't even get up. It went on for such a long time. By the time the sun went down, I couldn't use my lower body at all. After the first year, we were just like machines," she says.

Kim believes the years of physical abuse took a permanent toll on her body. Tears stream down her cheeks as she explains how she was never able to fulfill her dream of having children.

"When I started, the Japanese military would often beat me because I wasn't submissive," Kim says.

"There are no words to describe my suffering. Even now. I can't live without medicine. I'm always in pain."

Kim is part of an NGO called the "Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan," which is fighting for an apology.

Some Japanese prime ministers have personally apologized in the past, but the NGO director believes that it's not nearly enough.

Tokyo maintains its legal liability for the wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral claims treaty signed in 1965 between South Korea and Japan.

Kim's story matches testimony from other so-called "comfort women."

In Washington, as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conducts a state visit to the United States, former Korean sex slave Lee Yong-soo makes a tearful plea to him, demanding an official apology for Japan's sexual enslavement of an estimated 200,000 comfort women, mostly Korean and Chinese. Many have since passed away, but those still alive want individual compensation for their treatment.

Critics say Abe has not been vocal enough. They fear his government is trying to whitewash the past, to appease conservatives who feel comfort women were paid prostitutes, not victims of official military policy.

"When it comes to the comfort women sex slave system, it is pretty much unique to Japan. I think Nazi Germany had some of it to a smaller degree. But in the Japanese case it was large scale, and state-sponsored, essentially," says Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Tokyo's Sophia University.

Nakano points out that, since Abe first came to office his government has succeeded in removing references to "comfort women" from many Japanese school textbooks.

It's part of what critics call Japan's track record of glossing over its war crimes.

"(Comfort women) have gone through tremendous trauma. And in a way, the Japanese government risks a second rape by discrediting their testimonies and treating (their experiences) as if they were lies," Nakano says.

Abe insists he and other Prime Ministers have made repeated apologies.

"I am deeply pained to think of the comfort women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering," Abe told diet lawmakers last year.

Abe gave a similarly worded statement during a press conference Tuesday in Washington, DC -- leading critics to question the sincerity of Abe's expressions of remorse over the issue. Abe has said he does not believe women were coerced to work in the military brothels.

Nakano says Abe and conservative lawmakers feel "singled out."

"They feel there's some sort of a plot by other Asian countries to sully the Japanese name to their advantage."

With Abe's historic visit to the U.S. just months before the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two, Kim wants President Obama to pressure his key Asian ally to do more to acknowledge history.

Meanwhile, Kim has had enough of the excuses she says are hampering her efforts to finally get peace.

"To say there's no evidence is absurd. I am the evidence," she says.

Alan Pardew left Newcastle to take over as Crystal Palace manager . There have been rumours linking him with Magpies keeper Tim Krul . Pardew is disappointed that reports emerged suggesting the move . He says there has been no contact between him and the club or the player .
-----------------------------------------------
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists he is not interested in raiding former club Newcastle for Tim Krul and is disappointed that reports emerged suggesting he was planning a move.

Pardew is planning a busy summer in the transfer market after taking over at Palace and leading the team on an incredible run of form that has pulled them away from the relegation zone.

The 53-year-old made the shock decision to leave Newcastle for the south London club in January but maintains that he is happy with current No 1 Julian Speroni.

‘There’s been no contact between me, Newcastle, the player and the agent,’ Pardew said. ‘I’m surprised at that. It’s unwelcome. I’ve got a great relationship with my goalkeeper here. I’m confident that Krul will stay at Newcastle.

‘We’re looking at a number of players for the future but not a goalkeeper at the moment. We need to take the next step. We’re fortunate of the location we have and the crowd we get. There’s an opportunity to move forward quickly.

‘Whether that’s buying a player from Rotherham for £100,000 or a player from Inter Milan for £8million, well do what’s right for the club.’

Nakhi Wells opened the scoring after an error from on-loan Zeki Fryers . James Vaughan doubled the advantage after 30 minutes for the home side . Luke Varney pulled one back for Ipswich straight after the break . Ipswich have now lost four out of five away in the Championship .
-----------------------------------------------
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy was feeling less vibrant than his team's bright orange strip after they blew a chance to climb into the play-off places.

The Tractor Boys, who have now lost four of their last five away games, were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by Huddersfield strike pair Nahki Wells and James Vaughan.

McCarthy responded by making two changes at half-time and was rewarded when Luke Varney reduced arrears earlier in the second period.

Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies; Smith, Goberin, Hudson, Lynch, James; Scannell (Wallace 89), Goberin Coady, Butterfield; Wells (Edgar 83), Vaughan (Lolley 90)

Goals: Wells 12, Vaughan 30

Ipswich: Bialkowski; Chambers, Smith, Berra, Fryers; Chaplow (Bishop 45), Skuse, Tabb (Williams 67); Varney, Murphy, Wood (Sears 45)

Goal: Varney 48

Bookings: Smith, Berra 

But Ipswich couldn't force an equaliser let alone manage the victory that would have seen them leapfrog Brentford into the top six.

'We were poor – nowhere near as competitive as usual,' said McCarthy.

'I was very angry at half-time and strong words were spoken. 

'I had to walk off at the end to calm down slightly rather than shake all the players' hands. It's been disappointing, let's leave it at that.'

Huddersfield, who hadn't won in seven matches, went ahead after 12 minutes. 

Wells capitalised on loose play from Zeki Fryers and curled a left-footer into the corner for his 13th goal of the season.

Luke Varney (centre left) heads home early in the second half but it wasn't enough for Mick McCarthy's men 

After Ipswich's 23-goal top scorer Daryl Murphy had seen an effort cleared off the line, the home side extended their lead after half-an-hour when James Vaughan rose well to head in Jacob Butterfield's cross at the far post. 

Luke Varney headed a goal back after 48 minutes but Huddersfield deservedly held out to leave manager Chris Powell declaring: 'We deserved it. 

'Our first-half display was arguably the best we've played since I've been here. 

'Vaughan and Wells took it to them from minute one.

Fortunately for Ipswich's promotion hopes, three of their remaining five matches are at Portman Road starting with bottom-of-the-table Blackpool on Saturday.

McCarthy added: 'I don't feel happy-slappy at the moment but me and (assistant) Terry Connor will watch this game back at seven o'clock in the morning and we'll start preparing for the next one. 

'I don't have any fears about the response on Saturday.'

Yo ! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe is among new signatories of letter . He is a former Labour backer and appeared in a 2004 political broadcast . Total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter praising the Tories . The announcement will heap more pressure on Labour and Ed Miliband .
-----------------------------------------------
Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans – including a prominent former Labour supporter.

By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a ‘change in course’.

Among the new signatories is Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! Sushi and a former Labour backer.

Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans – including prominent former Labour supporter Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! Sushi

Others also include executives from two FTSE-100 firms and 10 from the FTSE-250 index. Adding their names were Philip Aiken, the chairman of construction giant Balfour Beatty, Dr Tom Enders, boss of Airbus, and Simon Litherland, head of drinks group Britvic.

All have signed in a personal capacity.

The announcement of the new names will heap pressure on Labour, which has struggled to come forward with notable numbers of business supporters.

Once a former prominent Labour supporter, Mr Woodroffe appears to have turned his back on the party despite appearing in a 2004 political broadcast.

Earlier this year, he warned that Labour’s approach to business ‘scares’ him. He told BBC Newsnight: ‘What I worry about with Ed Miliband is that he is appealing to the popular by saying, “look at all these fat cats” making lots of money it should be for the workers.’

‘Actually, I think the fat cats generally, sometimes it annoys me, but they pay their taxes, you know.’

 By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a ‘change in course’

The letter backs the lowering of corporation tax by David Cameron and George Osborne as it shows the UK is 'open for business' 

The letter states that the signatories believe the Conservative-led government ‘has been good for business and pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation’.

They praise the cuts in corporation tax to 20 per cent, which they say is a ‘key part’ of the Tory economic plan.

They add: ‘We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk.’

When the letter was first published in a newspaper last week it sent shockwaves through the election campaign.

Labour attempted to respond by positioning itself as the party of workers.

It announced plans to ban 90 per cent of zero hours contracts and make it easier for staff to sue their bosses for wrongful dismissal.

A poll of FTSE-100 chairman at the weekend showed seven out of ten think Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for Britain.

The anonymous poll, published by the Sunday Times, showed widespread concern by businesses about Labour’s economic plans.

Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par . The American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round . Justin Rose collected five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under . Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among those at six under after 68s .
-----------------------------------------------
Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth.

The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind.

Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ 

Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters

At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot

The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun.

Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday.

Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind.

As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’

World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth

Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday

What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’

For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more.

How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round.

Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’

And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. 

Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic

Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday

The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70.

What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double.

When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds.

So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. 

Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under

Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under

As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie.

McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today.

Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’

Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68.

And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.

Dax Internet Addiction Treatment Centre in Beijing has welcomed 6,000 patients since it opened its doors in 2006 . The military-style bootcamp claims to have cured 75 per cent of their addiction to electronic gadgets . Internet addiction or wangyin is said to affect 24 million of the China 's 632 million web users .
-----------------------------------------------
Fed up with Facebook, or coming to realise, in the words of David Cameron, ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’? It may be time to consider a short, sharp trip to the suburbs of Beijing.

Here, in a collection of drab, concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military-style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind: to treat victims of a very modern disease — a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets.

Formed in 2006, the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre (IATC) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young, mostly male patients — and claims to have ‘cured’ 75 per cent of them.

Smart salute: At the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, it’s time to put down that mouse, pull on a camouflage T-shirt and learn to click heels, not screen icons

The man behind the facility is Tao Ran, a doctor and colonel in the People’s Liberation Army, regarded as China’s leading expert in wangyin, or internet addiction, which is said by the country’s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users.

He describes wangyin as a form of mental illness, saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction.

Many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens, and a third suffer from eating disorders.

‘Internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but, generally, it’s even more damaging,’ Mr Ran said recently.

 ‘It destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing.’ 

To break it, Mr Ran confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict, military-style fitness regime, starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning. 

They must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication.

Progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans. Mr Ran only considers someone cured if, six months after their release, they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day.

Some critics have called the techniques brutal. But they also yield results and there is high demand for places: the IATC, which charges £1,000 per month (more than twice the average Chinese urban worker’s wage) recently expanded, so it can treat 130 patients at any one time.

Work that body: Military-style drills, exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor

Open wide: A nurse checks that 14-year-old Yin Yu Tao has taken his medication — all part of the £1,000-a-month bootcamp

It isn’t alone: there are around 300 such clinics in China, due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as World Of Warcraft. 

Many internet cafes have beds, so customers can sleep at their keyboards, and Shanghai recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors ‘being overindulgent with online and electronic games’.

Meanwhile in Japan, where Facebook and Twitter are national obsessions, there are dozens of so-called internet ‘fasting camps’. 

Taiwan is also facing up to internet addiction — in January, its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend ‘excessive time using electronic products’.

Tough love: Good posture is required at the super-strict bootcamp. Here, pupil Zhai Ye is encouraged to stand straight

No rest for the internet addicted: The day starts at 6.30am and is run with military precision, even for this very young inmate

Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud pleads not guilty to charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI . The Columbus , Ohio , resident became a U.S. citizen in February 2014 . In April 2014 , he went to Syria for terrorism training , prosecutors say in a news release .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)A naturalized U.S. citizen pleaded not guilty in Ohio Friday to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI.

Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, of Columbus, allegedly traveled to Syria for training and wanted to return home to kill Americans -- particularly U.S. soldiers, execution style, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.

Mohamud was remanded into custody on Friday.

"I am confident in the system working fairly and (in) our client getting a vigorous and aggressive defense," said his lawyer, Sam Shamansky.

Mohamud told someone that he wanted to target U.S. armed forces, police officers or other people in uniform, the indictment alleges, adding that "Mohamud's plan was to attack a military facility, and his backup plan was to attack a prison."

"Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States. He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style," it says.

Mohamud allegedly said he was happy that his brother, Aden, died fighting for al-Nusra Front, al Qaeda's largest affiliate in Syria. Mohamud told someone he planned to join Aden in death soon, the indictment says.

He became a U.S. citizen in February 2014 and submitted a U.S. passport application days later, according to the indictment.

Mohamud traveled to Syria in April 2014 "for the purpose of training and fighting with terrorists," prosecutors said in a news release.

To get there, Mohamud bought a one-way ticket to Greece with a layover in Istanbul, Turkey, the Department of Justice said. He skipped the connecting flight "and instead completed pre-arranged plans to travel to Syria."

Once there, he trained in shooting weapons, breaking into homes, using explosives and hand-to-hand combat, prosecutors said.

Mohamud "also stated that, after completing this training, he was instructed by a cleric in the organization to return to the United States and commit an act of terrorism."

CNN's John Newsome contributed to this story.

-----------------------------------------------
Brazil's World Cup stadium in Natal is up for sale as the company that owns it is suffering from cash flow problems following a corruption scandal.

Natal's Dunas Arena is being sold by owner Grupo OAS, with the company also trying to sell the 50 percent share it owns of the Fonte Nova arena in Salvador.

The company has struggled for months with the impact of a corruption investigation at state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which undercut the builder's access to financing.

A general view of Natal's Dunas Arena during the World Cup match between Italy and Uruguay last year

An economic downturn, government austerity and a slumping currency has also taken its toll, leading to Grupo OAS to announce it is selling its stakes in the stadiums and other businesses to focus on the core construction business.

OAS spent 591 million reais (around £126 million) on completely rebuilding the old Fonte Nova arena in Salvador and 423 million reais (£90 million) on the new Dunas area. The Fonte Nova hosted six games in the 2014 tournament and the Dunas Arena four.

The announcement was the latest in a string of bad news for Brazilian football post-World Cup.

Earlier this week Esporte Club Bahia, one of the biggest clubs in Salvador, said they were abandoning plans to use the Fonte Nova because they felt the owners did not respect their fans.

Several other stadiums have seen bigger crowds for concerts and religious events than for football and the ground in Cuiaba was closed because of structural problems.

The jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the months-long trial. On Wednesday, they convicted Hernandez, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days.

After the verdict, jurors agreed to meet with reporters, at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process.

Here are five things to know about what they said:

While declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room, jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision.

"It's a very big decision to make, and every one of us ... made sure we came to the best conclusion," one juror told reporters.

At one point on Monday, jurors asked Judge Susan Garsh to allow smoking breaks, which were permitted during trial. Some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations.

A male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony.

"It was hard ... for everyone," said a woman on the jury. "Everyone's life changed because of this."

Asked to elaborate, she told a reporter, "I've been here for as long as you have."

"It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life," she said later about serving on the jury. "Absolutely, by far."

Asked whether they would say anything to Hernandez, one of the women on the panel said simply, "Nothing." Others nodded in apparent agreement.

Do they have any feelings about the 25-year-old former star?

"For me, Judge Garsh said, 'Keep your mind suspended,' " said a female juror. "We went in there every day with open minds. We listened to the evidence. We heard what they had to say. We got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that's when we came to our conclusion."

Did they know anything about Hernandez or the case before the trial?

One juror responded: "Nothing."

"Very little," said another.

About six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a New England Patriots fan.

The jurors said they found out about Hernandez's other legal woes from Garsh only after they reached a verdict.

Hernandez potentially faces three more trials, one criminal and two civil actions.

Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012.

Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW. Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured.

Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.

The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots.

Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013.

Alexander Bradley claims Hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club.

"It's amazing a lot of the information we learned today," a female juror said Wednesday. "I think we can all say we made the right decision."

Some jurors admitted to not knowing who Patriots owner Robert Kraft was when he took the stand at the trial.

But they agreed that Kraft's testimony was crucial. Kraft testified that Hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that "he hoped that the time of the murder ... came out because I believe he said he was in a club."

"To this day -- we just went through a three-month trial, and this is now two years later -- we still don't know the exact time of Odin's murder," a male juror said. "So I don't know how Aaron would have had that information two years ago."

Another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of Lloyd's family and friends.

"For me, it was in the beginning -- the pictures," a woman said of autopsy photos of Lloyd's bullet-riddled body. "You're told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears ... (That) was hard."

One man said his time on the case made him "appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be."

And that the justice system can work.

"The system is designed to be fair to both sides," he said. "In fairness, you can't rush."

The jurors did not find credible the defense team's contention that Hernandez's co-defendants -- Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz -- carried out the murder. The two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.

In closing arguments, defense lawyer James Sultan for the first time placed Hernandez at the murder scene.

Sultan described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage.

"Did he make all the right decisions? No," Sultan said of Hernandez. "He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact. ... He's charged with murder ... and that he did not do."

"We were all shocked about that," a female juror told reporters Wednesday.

"It was very surprising," said another.

Asked about post-trial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case, a female juror smiled.

"None of us wanted to come into this room," she told the reporters gathered around her.

The jurors said they expected to sleep peacefully Wednesday night.

"After a beverage," one of them added.

Asked whether they were leaving the experience as friends, they all seemed to say, "Yes."

Previous popes had finessed the question of whether the killing of 1.5 million Armenians was genocide . Because he often shines such a smiley face on the world , it can be easy to forget the bluntness Francis sometimes brings to the bully pulpit .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)It's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country.

As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat?

This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma.

First, the back story:

One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism.

A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a "genocide." (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides.

For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question.

John Paul II used the "g" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together.

Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings "a great evil" and "terrible persecution" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.)

As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word "genocide."

He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document.

"In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies," Francis said. "The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people."

The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul.

In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins.

"The Vatican and the papacy love continuity," said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter.

If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said.

At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday.

"The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it," Reese said of the Armenian murders. "He's telling people: There's nothing new here."

New or not, Turkey was not happy.

The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for "consultations" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported.

In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word "unacceptable" and "out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis."

"Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations," the tweet reads.

"Hatred" and "animosity" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis.

Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different.

He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.)

But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the "Mexicanization" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch.

On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his "genocide" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had.

"We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard," Francis said.

CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

John Sutton Jr was just 8 years old in 1940 , when his blacksmith father took him to his first Kentucky Derby . The 84-year-old Louisville native has n't missed a race since , and has amassed an impressive collection of memorabilia over the past 76 races .

-----------------------------------------------
John Sutton Jr has spent the first Saturday of May the same way since he was 8 years old - on the sidelines of the Kentucky Derby. 

To commemorate his dedication to horse racing, Churchill Downs - the track that hosts the race every year - is inviting the 84-year-old man to attend his 76th-straight Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2. 

This week, Sutton invited a reporter from WAVE 3 into the Louisville home he shares with his wife of 61 years Doris, where she spoke about his very first Derby and showed off his impressive collection of racing memorabilia. 

Scroll down for video 

Dedicated: Churchill Downs is inviting John Sutton Jr, 84, to attend the Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2, since he has attended every race for the past 76 years 

Winner, winner: Sutton was just 8 years old in 1940 when his father brought him to his first race, and the two bet against the favorite on a horse called Gallahadion, which ended up winning the race 

Among the masses: Above, a view of the crowds at Churchill Downs on the day of the 1940 race 

Sutton says he was just 8 years old in 1940 when his blacksmith father brought him to his first Kentucky Derby. 

'Once the race started, we would crash the gates, so to speak to get on the rail or wherever we could get,' Sutton recalled. 

That year, Sutton and his father decided to bet on the horse Gallahadion, instead of the favorite, Bimelech. 

And to their delight, Gallahadion pulled through to an unexpected victory that helped cement Sutton's love for the sport. 

Living history: Sutton has collected a program from every Kentucky Derby he has attended and keeps them in a binder at home. Above, some of the early years 

Through the years: The Derby programs got more and more colorful over the years 

Keepsakes: In addition to programs, Sutton has Kentucky Derby glasses stretching back more than seven decades 

Autographs: Sutton got jockeys to sign several of his programs, which he proudly displays in frames at home

Entry: Above, some of the tickets Sutton has collected from the Kentucky Derby since 1940 

An eye for champions: Sutton won $600 dollars in 19567, when he bet on the winning horse Proud Clarion. Proud Clarion and jockey Bobby Ussery pictured above after placing first at Churchill Downs 

Every year since then, Sutton has attended the Kentucky Derby and has collected each year's program since then, which he keeps in a binder at home. 

He also has kept a collection of his tickets, Derby glasses from the more than seven decades he has attended the race as well as pins and and other programs signed by jockeys. 

In his early years attending the Derby, Sutton says the day involved a bit of hard work going around to each betting window to buy tickets for his parents, and picking them up snacks for the main event on the way back. 

But he continues to come back year after year, placing his bets by averaging the past performances of the horses competing. 

That method won him one of his biggest prizes in 1967, when the then 35-year-old Sutton placed his money on winning horse Proud Clarion and got $600 in return. 

'There's nothing like having a winning ticket,' he said, 'You just all of a sudden get smarter you know.'

John Tuite , 22 , and Carlos Santolalla , 25 , share an Instagram account that their old agencies pressured them to delete . The couple claims that the world of male modeling is n't as gay-friendly as most people believe . The in-demand duo also DJs at hot New York City clubs and rubs shoulders with celebrities .
-----------------------------------------------
The couple that models designer clothes together stays together — or at least that's what one New York-based duo hope, having just inked a deal as the first openly gay couple with Fusion Models.

John Tuite, 22, and Carlos Santolalla, 25, go by the Brangelina-like portmanteau Jarlos, and have already earned a following in the modeling world and on New York City's party scene.

But while the male model It Couple have starred in a campaign together for DKNY and posed for big brands like Edun and DSquared2, they say it hasn't always been easy for them to work in the industry and be true to themselves.

Model couple: Carlos Santolalla, 25, left, and John Tuite, 22, right, are the first openly gay couple to be signed together to a modeling agency

Though the fashion industry seems very accepting of gay people, the couple explains that models are still expected to appear masculine or androgynous.

Both John and Carlos had to drop their old agencies after they were told to act straight and delete the Instagram account they share, where they often post loving images of themselves kissing and hugging.

'After coming out, I didn’t want to be weird about it again and act straight at castings,' John told The Cut in December. 

'The weird thing about models — something that nobody really realizes — is that they’re all straight,' Carlos recently told Out magazine. 

Growing fan base: On Instagram, the couple goes by the joint nickname Jarlos, and they have over 22,500 followers

Facing obstacles: John and Carlos were told by their previous modeling agencies to act more 'butch' and delete their joint Instagram account, where they often pose kissing and holding hands

'There is an unspoken rule of modeling, at least in NYC — even if you get signed as an out model — the first thing any agent tells you to do is to dress butch and talk about girls so no one "finds out",' John added.

In fact, when the couple first got together over three years after meeting at a casting call, it was because Carlos became interested in John when he realized he might be gay — which he says was unusual. 

Soon the pair became well-known on the New York City party scene, getting snapped with celebrities like model Gigi Hadid and Paris Hilton, DJing at trendy clubs, and even curating art shows.

'We used to sneak into parties we weren’t invited to at all and try to take pictures of famous people,' John said. 'Now we’re invited and covering it and DJing.' 

Looking good: The couple explained that though the modeling industry is filled with well-groomed, well-dressed men, most male models are straight

Party hard: Jarlos is well known on the New York party circuit and has been pictured with Gigi Hadid, Paris Hilton, and Harry Styles

The fact that the pair has become so widely known as a couple made them even more appealing to Fusion Models.

'We signed them as a duo because they are both models and they DJ as a duo, under the name Jarlos,' Fusion's Alexandra Phipps told Dazed. 'They’ve made a name for themselves as a team, so we decided to run with it.'

As for John and Carlos, they are as excited to be making strides for gay models as they are to have signed this new deal.

'Finally being represented as an openly gay man, let alone a couple, is a huge milestone for the industry, and the whole gay community,' John said. 'We hope that this will send a message to younger generations that it's possible to succeed without compromising who you are.'

It has been eight years since an English club triumphed in the European Champions Cup . Despite four English teams in this year 's quarter-finals , that hoodoo looks set to persist . English clubs are nowhere near as well-resourced as French clubs . In a World Cup year , it would be a huge boost to national morale if English clubs could progress further into the competition .
-----------------------------------------------
It is eight long, barren years since an English club claimed the top prize in European rugby and the bookmakers aren't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year.

When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game.

This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs.

In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen.

The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents.

Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18.

If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin.

Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent.

Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition.

There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale.

-----------------------------------------------
After Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus announced that it will no longer have elephants in the show starting in 2018, the organization gave a rare tour of the facility where the elephants will retire. 

Once the animals are done in the ring, they'll be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. 

Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. 

Scroll down for video 

All elephants will be phased out of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performance by 2018

Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida

Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'.

Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population.  

The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. 

Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. 

Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. 

Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding

A spokesman for the center said that the organization's goal is to conserve the Asian Elephant, an animal who has seen massive population decline over the last century

Much of the population decline - which has gone down from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000 - has been caused by poaching and habitat destruction

'Zoos don't chain elephants and the American Veterinary Medical Association advises against it' Delciana Windners, PETA general counsel, told FOX.  

The animal-rights organizations also urge the company to take the animals off the road sooner. 

Just days before announcing that the elephants would be taken out of the ring, PETA prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis.

TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact.

A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country.

'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read.  

Animal rights groups, including PETA, have said that Ringling Brothers should take elephants out of their shows before 2018

PETA released information earlier this year stating that at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis

Manchester City defeated West Ham 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday . Sam Allardyce was seen ranting at fourth official during game at the Etihad . Hammers boss explained he was frustrated that referee Anthony Taylor missed Eliaquim Mangala 's foul on Stewart Downing .
-----------------------------------------------
Sam Allardyce has revealed the reason behind his furious rant at fourth official Robert Madley towards the end of West Ham’s defeat at Manchester City on Sunday.

The Hammers boss was incensed that Eliaquim Mangala was not penalised for a foul against Stewart Downing, who managed to stay on his feet despite a late challenge from City’s £32million defender.

Referee Anthony Taylor took no action as the ball ran out of play and an animated Allardyce vented his fury towards Madley on the touchline.

Allardyce cannot resist taking an extended pop at Madley from the sidelines

It was highlighted on Match of the Day but the 60-year-old later questioned whether Downing had paid the price for his honesty instead of taking a fall and earning his team a freekick.

‘Everybody goes on about simulation and players cheating and doing this and that,’ said Allardyce. ‘Mangala comes out and tries to clean out Stewart Downing.

‘Downing stays on his feet and the assistant is one yard off and doesn’t flag for the foul. So what do I say to Stewart Downing? “For God’s sake dive on the floor and get a freekick?” Because we could put the freekick in and get a goal.’

Allardyce was unhappy with Downing for giving away possession in the build-up to City’s second goal scored by Sergio Aguero, having already conceded an own-goal from James Collins.

Allardyce was aggrieved because a foul by Eliaquim Mangala on Stewart Downing (not pictured) was missed

Sergio Aguero finished off a fine move to hand the Champions a 2-0 win to get their season back on track

He added: ‘The disappointing thing in the first half was the goals we gifted to City and the amount of possession we allowed ourselves to lose.

‘The two mistakes we make for the goals, one was pretty bizarre and the other unexpected from a player as experienced as Stewart Downing.

‘In the second half eventually changing the system got us going forward, and when we create as good chances as those for Enner Valencia and Kevin Nolan we have to convert them. But the most disappointing thing was the goals we gifted City.’

Baseball has long been considered America's favorite pastime, so it should come as no surprise that most people feel very strongly when it comes to their favorite professional team. 

And there are no two baseball teams that are greater, or more storied, than eternal rivals the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, who come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite.

Also making a very impressive showing are the Texas Rangers and Atlanta Braves, who have fans across a wide area in the South.

Then there are a few teams who don't get as much love - like the New York Mets.

The Mets are not the favorite team in one county in the country, with fans in their area seeming to all go for the Yankees.

Same goes for the Oakland Athletics. 

The Toronto Blue Jays can also claim almost all of Canada, though the Yankees and Red Sox are also favorites in some areas.

The graph, created by Facebook, uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner.

And with the exception of those aforementioned Yankees, Red Sox and recent World Series champs San Francisco Giants, who get some love in Hawaii, most teams only really get support near their home field.

Ulster said that 31-year-old Fitzpatrick had 'experienced a number of concussive episodes' in recent seasons, and his symptoms were 'progressively slower to resolve'.

Medics at the Guinness PRO12 province referred him to a neurologist, and after tests it was recommended it would be in Fitzpatrick's long-term interests to stop playing.

Ulster and Ireland Declan Fitzpatrick has been forced to retire on medical grounds after multiple concussions

Fitzpatrick won seven caps for Ireland, the last of which was against New Zealand during the 2013 autumn Tests. He also made 98 Ulster appearances.

'While it is not an easy decision to hang up the boots, I can look back with fondness at nine fantastic seasons at Ulster Rugby,' Fitzpatrick said.

'It was a huge honour to have represented my country and an enormous privilege to pull on that green shirt.

'I want to thank the medical teams at Ulster Rugby and the IRFU (Irish Rugby Football Union) for the care that they have given me.

'My symptoms continue to improve, and I know the advice that I received is in the best interests of my long-term health.'

Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord concluded military suicides may be more likely after members leave service than during deployment . The four-year study looked at military records of 3.9 million service members from October 7 , 2001 to December 31 , 2007 . Total of 31,962 deaths occurred , including 5,041 suicides , by December 31 , 2009 . There were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who did n't . Soldiers with a dishonorable discharge were twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had honorable discharge .
-----------------------------------------------
A new comprehensive study of 3.9million military personnel who served after 9/11 has found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates.

Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, concluded that military suicides may be more likely after members leave the service than during active duty deployment, particularly if their time in uniform is brief.

‘It was certainly intuitive as the wars went on and suicides went up for people to assume that deployment was the reason, but our data show that that is too simplistic; when you look at the total population, deployment is not associated with suicide,’ said lead author Mark Reger.

New study: Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord looked at military records of 3.9million personnel who served after 9/11 and found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates

Matter of honor: Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation

The four-year study, the largest of its kind, was published Wednesday in the Journal of American Medicine Association Psychiatry.

While the US military has traditionally experienced lower suicide rates than the civilian population, suicides among active duty service members have surged in the past decade, almost doubling in the Army and the Marines Corps, Reger said.

In 2012, Pentagon reported 320 suicides by active-duty service members; another 268 soldiers took their lives last year.

To understand the relationship between deployment and self-inflicted death, researchers reviewed military records for more than 3.9million active-duty soldiers and reservists who joined up between October 7, 2001 and December 31, 2007.

A total of 31,962 deaths occurred, including 5,041 suicides, by December 31, 2009.

Suicide rates were similar regardless of whether or not servicemen and women were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.

The study did not factor in veterans’ exposure to combat and the potential effect of traumatic events on the battlefield on suicide rates.

There were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who didn't, representing suicide rates per 100,000 person-years of 18.86 and 17.78, respectively.

Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, however, with a suicide rate of 26.06 after separating from service compared with 15.12 for those who remained in uniform.

At home and abroad: Suicide rates were similar regardless of whether or not servicemen and women were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan 

Those who left sooner had a greater risk, with a rate of 48.04 among those who spent less than a year in the military.

Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation.

‘This is the first time such a huge, comprehensive study has found an increased suicide risk among those who have separated from service, particularly if they served for less than four years or had an other than honorable discharge,’ said Rajeev Ramchand, a researcher in military mental health and suicide prevention at Rand Corporation who wasn't involved in the study.

It's possible that pre-deployment examinations may screen out people who have mental health problems, making those who deploy several times a healthier, more resilient group, said Dr. Alan Peterson, a psychologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio who specializes in combat-related post traumatic stress disorder.

‘Those who really struggle with a deployment don't go the second time,’ said Peterson, a retired military psychologist who wasn't involved in the study. ‘Early separation from the military is often a marker for something else.’

For those contemplating suicide, access to firearms can exacerbate the problem, Peterson said.

‘It's a risk factor that sometimes gets overlooked, but we've seen when they don't have access to weapons they are less likely to kill themselves.’

Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, and those who left after just one year were most vulnerable 

Some service members who leave the military early may have had risk factors for suicide such as mood disorders or substance abuse problems that contributed to their separation, particularly if they had a dishonorable discharge, said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

It isn't realistic to expect former service members to instantly reintegrate into their former civilian lives, but they may be experiencing serious mental health problems if they're not eating or sleeping or if they're extremely agitated or irritable, Moutier said.

‘The lack of an association between deployment and suicide risk isn't surprising,’ she said. ‘At a very high level, these findings highlight the need for us to pay closer attention to what happens when people leave the military.’

The flexible aluminium battery was created at Stanford University . It consists of a negatively charged aluminium anode and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte . It sits in a flexible polymer-coated ` pouch ' and recharges in one minute . But it currently offers just half the voltage of existing lithium-ion batteries .
-----------------------------------------------
The frustration of waiting hours for your phone to charge could soon be a thing of the past thanks to an aluminium battery that recharges in less than 60 seconds. 

And the technology is both greener and safer than current batteries, as well as being flexible.

It is the first high-performance aluminium battery that is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive', according to its designers.

The aluminium battery (pictured) was created at Stanford University. It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery that is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive'

The aluminium battery was created at Stanford University, California, and the findings have been published in the journal Nature. 

Lead author and professor of chemistry at the university, Hongjie Dai, said: 'We have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames.

'Our new battery won't catch fire, even if you drill through it.'

Aluminium is cheap and has a low flammability coupled with a high-charge storage capacity.

The aluminium battery was created at Stanford University. 

It consists of  a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte.

These sit inside a flexible polymer-coated pouch.

And while lithium-ion batteries can take hours to charge, the new battery has 'unprecedented charging times' of down to one minute.

Unlike other prototypes which die after just 100 charges, the Stanford battery can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity. 

It is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries, and can't catch fire like lithium-ion technology. 

At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium.' 

But the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium-ion technology.

But scientists have struggled to make a commercially viable aluminium-ion battery because of the difficulty in finding materials capable of producing sufficient voltage after repeated cycles of charging and discharging.

The aluminum-ion battery consists of two electrodes - a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte. 

These sit inside a flexible polymer-coated pouch.

Stanford graduate student Ming Gong added: 'The electrolyte is basically a salt that's liquid at room temperature, so it's very safe. 

'Lithium-ion batteries can be a fire hazard.

'In our study, we have videos showing that you can drill through the aluminium battery pouch, and it will continue working for a while longer without catching fire.

'But lithium batteries can go off in an unpredictable manner in the air, the car or in your pocket. Besides safety, we have achieved major breakthroughs in aluminium battery performance.'

And while lithium-ion battery can take hours to charge, the new battery has 'unprecedented charging times' of down to one minute.

Unlike other prototypes which die after just 100 charges, the Stanford battery can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity.

By comparison, a typical lithium-ion battery lasts about 1,000 cycles.

Mr Gong continued: 'Another feature of the aluminum battery is flexibility.

'You can bend it and fold it, so it has the potential for use in flexible electronic devices. Aluminium is also a cheaper metal than lithium.'

At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium.'

But the researchers explained the battery has a limited voltage, compared to existing technology.

'Our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery,' Professor Dai said:

'But improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density.

'Otherwise, our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life. I see this as a new battery in its early days. It's quite exciting.'

Celine Bisette , from Canada , became an escort when she was in college . She wants to feel proud of her job , but complains that she is constantly battling the negative opinions of others . The writer , who uses a pseudonym , has her master 's degree but explains that sex work pays more than jobs in her field of study .
-----------------------------------------------
A Canadian prostitute says that she wishes  other people wouldn't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job.

Celine Bisette, who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career, insists she is neither 'damaged' nor 'deranged' - that, in fact, she rather enjoys being a prostitute, and it's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy.

'I am embarrassed to be a sex worker, even though I like my job, I’m good at it, and I’ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years,' she wrote in a recent essay for xoJane.

This pro has pride: Canadian prostitute Celine Bisette, pictured here, wishes other people wouldn't make her feel embarrassed about her job

First, Celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they've made about prostitutes. She claims that she didn't have an abusive childhood, she's not a 'hyper-sexual nympho', and she isn't uneducated.

She had 'an incredibly fortunate upbringing', she said, adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister: '[It was] just about the best any child could possibly hope for.'

Then, as a 19-year-old college sophomore, she found herself in need of a way to pay for school. A minimum-wage job wouldn't earn her enough money, and she didn't want to take out student loans. Her best option, she said, was the sex industry.

'I couldn’t bring myself to do porn, and I knew wasn’t talented enough to be a stripper,' she explained.

Working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for Celine, as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills. It just didn't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision.

In the beginning, she'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work. She was still out-going then, she said, and never felt self-conscious.

But peoples' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job. They would lecture her, insult her, and accuse her of being a 'traitor to feminism'.

One friend told everyone in their social circle that Celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career, and might have even been molested as a child. The rumor took off, and Celine lost a lot of friends in the process.

Now, after about a decade in the industry, she is much more reticent about revealing what she does, for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions. But while she has a 'mainstream' part-time job that she uses as a 'cover', she finds it frustrating that she can't be more open.

'I wish I could feel proud of who I am and what I do,' she said. 'I’m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed.'

Sexy and smart: Celine, who wants to keep her real identity a secret, says she's more than just an escort - she also has her master's degree in sociology

Even when she does tell people about her work as an escort, Celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master’s degree in sociology: 'I hype it up and draw attention to it, as if to say, “Yes, I’m a [prostitute], but I’m also smart and normal, really, I promise!”'

Because of the social stigma, she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy, her schedule is flexible, and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study.

Plus, she explained, she can't erase her history in the sex industry.

'I will always be seen as damaged goods, whether I am a current sex worker or a former one. So I might as well just keep going, right?' 

In fact, despite liking her job, it's not Canada's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give Celine pause - being paid for sex is legal, but living off that payment of it is not. Rather, it's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all.

'I wish I’d known what I was getting myself into before I jumped into this line of work,' she said. 'But most of all, I wish I’d never become a prostitute in the first place.'

A magistrate has refused to ban the media from naming the former head of child safety at Education Queensland who has been charged with child sex offences.

The 52-year-old has been free on bail since March, when he was charged with sexually and indecently assaulting two 12-year-old boys at schools in Sydney more than 25 years ago. 

Brett Anthony O'Connor's lawyer, Phillip Mulherin, applied for a suppression order in the Tweed Heads Local Court on Monday.

Mr Mulherin argued that identifying his client would cause undue stress and embarrassment.

Magistrate Michael Dakin refused the request after an ABC spokesperson made an application to the court for the case to remain open on behalf of the news organisations.

However, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin, the magistrate did agree to suppress the details of the victims and any witnesses.

-----------------------------------------------
A traumatised mother has been left with a phobia of all things yellow after she was hit by a canary-coloured taxi.

Lorraine Cobourn cannot even handle bananas following the incident that left her with a broken hip.

The 51-year-old had to leave her job as a Barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered when the yellow taxi struck her in May last year.

She has received two payouts and is now undergoing counselling to help her deal with the psychological damage she received - including a terrible fear of anything yellow.

Lorraine Cobourn (pictured) cannot even handle bananas after being hit by a yellow taxi in May last year

Ms Cobourn, of Oakwood, Derby, said: 'It sounds crazy I know, but I can't even touch bananas unless they're wrapped in cellophane - and I only ever buy green ones.

'I can't look at yellow number plates either. And If something yellow comes into the corner of my eye when I am watching TV I have to switch channels.

'I also gasp or sigh if I see a yellow taxi when I am out. I'm terrified of them, and if I saw a yellow taxi on the street I would feel this urge just to drive into it.'

She added: 'Obviously I didn't but it felt like there was something in my brain that needed to be released.

'It's very difficult but I try to have yellow flowers in my house to try and cure this fear.'

She added: 'It has had an absolutely massive impact on my life.

'The whole incident was incredibly traumatic and I am still coming to terms with it. I cannot face returning to the accident site.

The mother-of-two was hit by one of Derby's distinctive yellow Hackney Carriages (pictured) in the city centre

The 51-year-old had to leave her job as a Barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered

'You never expect something like this to happen to you.'

She was struck by one of Derby's distinctive yellow Hackney Carriages in the city centre as she crossed a road ten months ago.

She was hit as the cab reversed at speed - before the driver left the scene without helping her.

He initially denied any involvement in the incident, but was charged with driving without due care and attention, eventually pleading guilty to the offence on the day of his trial.

He was fined £400 pounds and given seven penalty points.

Speaking about the accident, Ms Cobourn said: 'I looked up and the next thing I knew I was on the road. I couldn't feel anything from my waist down, I thought I had broken both my legs. The pain was like nothing I have ever felt before - it was absolutely agonising.'

Chromophobia, also known as chromatophobia or chrematophobia, is a persistent, irrational fear of colours.

More severe cases of this phobia can hinder daily activities for some people.

People with the phobia may associate a distressing event with a specific colour. 

The phobia can develop following a trauamatic event involved either one or more colours, while some people become sensitive only to particular shades. 

Fears of specific colour is called erythrophobia for the fear of red and leukophobia for the fear of white.

Although actually clinical phobias to colours are rare, colours can elicit psychological reactions or hormonal responses. 

Symptoms can vary and may include anxiety, including palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breath and tremors.

Effective treatment for this phobia involves methods that include systematic desensitization and therapy. 

She initially had pins put in her hip at the Royal Derby Hospital but later needed a second operation - and a complete replacement. 

She now has to rely on son Jack, 16, to help around the house.

She has received two interim payments to help pay her mortgage and bills while injury lawyers deal with her claim for compensation. 

The taxi driver's insurers have already admitted liability.

Ms Cobourn added: 'One of the most difficult aspects to deal with was the fact the driver did not try to help me and also denied the incident.

'I had to brace myself for a criminal trial only for the guilty plea to come at the last minute - when paired with my health problems, it was incredibly hard to cope with.

'The financial support my lawyers have secured has been a huge help and really eased my financial worries while I have been unable to work.

'I'm now looking to the future and hope that gaining justice regarding the crash will help me to move forward with my life.'

Ian Whittaker, an associate solicitor at legal firm Irwin Mitchell, which is representing Ms Cobourn, said: 'This case is a terrible example of the life-changing consequences that road traffic collisions can have on those involved.

'Not only did Mrs Cobourn need major hip surgery and require adaptations to her home, but she has suffered financial worries due to being unable to work and continues to receive counselling support as she works to come to terms with the psychological effects of the incident.

'We are delighted to have helped her secure interim payments that provide reassurance and financial support at this incredibly difficult time, and also hope to work quickly to help her secure justice regarding her case following the admission of liability from the driver's insurer.'

V.K. Singh is leading the operation to evacuate Indians trapped in war-torn Yemen . The minister reportedly said the exercise was less exciting that visiting the Pakistan High Commission . Angry Singh branded a section of the media ` presstitutes ' after they quoted him . Congress called his statement ` abusive ' and ` lamentable '
-----------------------------------------------
After drawing praise for India’s operation to rescue around 2,000 nationals by air and sea from war-hit Yemen, Minister of State for External Affairs V.K Singh, who is spearheading the rescue exercise, found himself in the thick of a controversy over an unsavoury remark made against the media.

The former army chief is currently staying in Djibouti for over a week spearheading Operation Rahat. 

“Friends what do you expect from presstitutes….” Gen. Singh tweeted last night in response to a channel quoting him saying that he found the evacuation assignment less exciting than his recent visit to the Pakistan High Commission on the occasion of Pakistan's national day. 

The comment evoked sharp reactions, with the Opposition demanding an apology from the Union minister. 

But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has distanced itself from the former army chief’s views. 

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said: “Twitter is a personal platform. The meaning of a tweet can be best explained by the person who has tweeted.” 

But the comment has not gone down well with journalists, and the Broadcast Editors’ Association found the tweet to be offensive. The association’s general secretary, N.K. Singh, said that such comments damage the image of the government. 

Congress irked 

The Congress also grabbed the opportunity to corner the NDA government and demanded that the minister be sacked. 

“It is very unfortunate that a minister is using abusive language against the media. He is holding a very important position. It is for the prime minister to take a call on this,” said Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed. 

“Singh’s statement shows utter intolerance and incapacity to hear any kind of criticism or dissent,” the Indian National Congress said on its Twitter handle, quoting its spokesman Abhishek Singhvi. 

Another party spokesman Sanjay Jha tweeted: “General V.K. Singh’s choice of dreadful terms to attack Indian media is not just politically inappropriate but seriously lamentable.” 

This is not the first time when General Singh’s tweets have stirred a storm. The Union minister had tweeted “duty” and “disgust” soon after attending a reception hosted by Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit in New Delhi, where Kashmiri separatists were also invited. 

The Yemen rescue: Indian nationals in Dijibouti before taking off for Mumbai

Singh had represented the government at the Pakistan Day reception and his tweets were read as his displeasure. 

But the Union minister later clarified that his comment was directed at the media’s twists to the whole episode and that he was misinterpreted. 

The former army chief has vented his anger at the media several times in the past as well. He has used the word “pressitute” earlier, too, when reports pointing fingers at him for attempting a coup had appeared in the media. 

The latest episode has hit the government at a time when the flawless execution of Operation Rahat was being hailed by all. 

The mammoth effort saw 4,000 Indians being brought home safely from the war zone in Yemen besides many citizens of other countries. 

The former army chief is not known to mince his words. He is not the only one in the government who had uncomfortable relations with a section of media.

'Rahat' brings Indians home from Yemen 

By Mail Today Bureau in New Delhi 

India has pulled off an impressive mission by evacuating nearly 2,000 (by air and sea) nationals during a gruelling operation in the war-hit Yemen. 

Operation Rahat, as the elaborate humanitarian assistance exercise was christened, has entered its last phase as not many are left to be pulled out from Yemen where Houthi fighters are resisting a Saudi Arabia- led offensive in a war that has left hundreds dead. 

The Houthis are a Zaidi group that takes its name from Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who launched an insurgency in 2004 before being reportedly killed by the Yemeni army. 

Led by Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the group carried out a coup in 2014–15 and as of now controls capital Sana’a and the parliament. 

Three warships, two IAF super heavy transporters, two merchant vessels and two Air India jets helped ferry Indians and some foreigners to safety. 

Officials said that air operations are being called off, but the naval warships will remain till the last person is evacuated. 

Minister of State for External Affairs V.K. Singh, who was in the centre of a storm for a remark against the media, led the evacuation operation from Djibouti located on the Horn of Africa across the Gulf of Aden. 

Singh had created a controversy on Tuesday when he said: “Actually speaking, the operation (evacuation) in Yemen is less exciting than going to the Pakistani embassy.” 

On Wednesday, he sparked fresh storm by referring to a section of the media as ‘presstitutes’. 

The Indians were taken out on warships and Air India planes from Yemen and brought to Djibouti before being sent home. It was a Herculean effort considering the numbers involved and the situation on the ground, which was deteriorating with every passing day. 

As the air operations were being called off on April 8, naval warship INS Tarkash reached Djibouti from Al Hodeidah port with 74 people on board and INS Sumitra entered the Al Hodeidah harbour of Yemen on the Red Sea. 

Along with destroyer INS Mumbai, the three naval warships made several sorties from Djibouti to the three port cities in Yemen - Al Hodeidah, Aden and Al Mukalla - to bring back the stranded Indians who were told to assemble at these points from the hinterland. 

The ministry of external affairs coordinated smoothly with various agencies to ensure that the passage back home was safe and secured.

Sudheer Khamitkar , shot his wife , Smita Haval Khamitkar , and their sons Arnav Khamitkar , 10 and Arush Khamitkar , six , earlier this week . Their bodies were found after Mrs Khamitkar 's employers , American Airlines , requested a welfare check when she failed to turn up to work . Police say they still do not have any motive but are speaking to Mr Khamitkar 's employers ; he recently switched jobs , they said .
-----------------------------------------------
Investigators are trying to determine why a man shot his wife and two young sons before killing himself at the family's home in a quiet Oklahoma suburb this week.

Sudheer Khamitkar, 42, shot his 38-year-old wife, Smita Haval Khamitkar, and their sons Arnav Khamitkar, 10 and Arush Khamitkar, 6, in separate rooms at their Tulsa home, police said.

The bodies were found on Wednesday as officers conducted a welfare check requested by the mother's employer after she failed to show up for work or call in sick for two days.

'Right now we still don't know the motive behind the murder-suicide,' said Sergeant Shane Tuell. 

Gunned down: Smita Haval Khamitkar, pictured with one of her sons, was shot by her husband along with their two boys - aged six and 10 - before he turned the gun on himself. Their bodies were found on Wednesday

On Thursday, Tuell said the father had recently changed jobs and that detectives would interview his current and former employers in an effort to learn if he was having personal troubles. 

There was no indication of forced entry and no suspects are being sought, authorities said. A backdoor was unlocked and a handgun was found near the father's body.

'The evidence indicates that the father shot and killed the children and the wife before turning the gun on himself,' said homicide Sergeant Dave Walker in a news release.

'There is evidence of multiple gunshots throughout the house. All the bodies were found in different rooms throughout the house.' 

Sergeant Walker added that the family had lived at the home for 10 years and there had been no previous history of domestic violence or criminal activity at the home, Newson6 reported.

Questions: Tulsa police gather at the front entrance of a home as they investigate after a father shot dead his wife, their children and himself in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Wednesday. They are still searching for a motive

Tulsa police captain Matt McCord said the bodies may have been in the house for 'as many as two days' 

Mrs Khamitkar, whose Facebook page indicates she was originally from Pune in India, had worked as an Android app developer for American Airlines.

'Smita Khamitkar was a member of the American Airlines team in Tulsa for nearly five years and we're deeply saddened by the news of her passing,' the company said in a statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Smita's family, friends and colleagues during this very difficult time.'

Online profiles for Mr Khamitkar show he had trained and worked as a mechanical engineer for companies including Oseco, a relief systems company, and Wellman Products Group, a company that develops car parts. 

He had also secured multiple patents in previous years for new types of rupture discs - a device that prevents equipment or a system from being damaged by too much pressure.

Neighbors said they were shocked by the events and called the area safe.

Most every property in the neighborhood has a large fence, so children can play or swim in privacy, though some play basketball in the driveway or at a cul-de-sac.

'I love this neighborhood. It's very quiet here,' Mercedes Perez told The Associated Press. 

Police investigate the scene after the bodies of four people were found following a welfare check

Her husband, Vinicio Perez, said he would sometimes see two children playing and bouncing around in the front yard of the home where the bodies were found.

'I'm shocked,' he said. 'This place should be a place surrounded by security.'  

Stephen Wiseman lived next door to the family for almost ten years.

He said: They were wonderful, the most kind [and] gentle people you'd ever meet. Our kids played with them all day on Saturday, and … we saw the kids on Sunday.'

Another neighbor reported hearing noises at the house late on Monday.

A democratic congressman is at the head of a group of representatives trying to help undocumented immigrants avoid deportations with what they have called the Family Defender Toolkit. 

The informational pamphlet includes a bilingual card - that some are calling a 'get out of deportation free card' - that lists reasons a person should not be deported under expanded. 

Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez said that if a person is arrested of detained, he or she can 'explain that under the policy in place today, you should be released because you are not a priority for deportation'. 

Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez is at the head of several house representatives who are creating a 'Family Defender Toolkit' that they hope will help undocumented immigrants avoid deportations

The toolkit includes a wallet-sized card that Gutierrez says should be shown to immigration officers when an undocumented immigrant is in an emergency situation

The two-page booklet details President Barack Obama's expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies.

Those policies, however, are currently on hold by a court order, according to FOX News Latino. 

Gutierrez said that though the policy is still on hold, he wanted those who might need the information to have it in advance. 

'I created this toolkit for you to protect yourself from deportation,' Gutierrez said in an introduction video to the booklet. 

He continued: 'Even though you cannot apply yet for the expanded DACA  and new DAPA you can still prepare.'

The Representative added, however, that he hopes people 'never have to use this card' and that it should only be used when speaking to immigration officials, 

The two-page booklet details President Barack Obama's expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies, which have been placed on hold by a court order

He said the card, which should be kept in a wallet, should not police officers in situations of minor infraction, according to CBS.  

Critics of the toolkit claim that the card is 'flaunting the law' and encourages a false sense of security for undocumented immigrants.   

'Rep. Gutierrez is only interested in open borders, which wreak havoc on the 93 million middle-class Americans already out of work and the millions more who are seeing their wages reduced due to companies hiring illegal workers,' said Aaron del Mar, Republican Party Chairman from Cook County, Illinois, said.

A hearing in which the Department of Justice will try to reverse the hold on President Obama's executive immigration action is scheduled for Friday.

Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $ 1.6 billion fraud case in 2009 . The software services exporter 's chairman , Ramalinga Raju , admitted inflating profits . Satyam had been India 's fourth-largest software services provider .
-----------------------------------------------
New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said.

Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN.

In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash.

Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher.

A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars.

When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means "truth" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider.

It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries.

After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group.

A heavyweight of the nation's software industry, Raju, 60, has been in jail for the past 32 months.

He had founded Satyam in 1987. His company made giant strides as the outsourcing business grew in India in the 1990s.

Susie Clark , of Evening Shade , Arkansas , found the diamond on Thursday at Crater of Diamonds State Park . The 3.69-carat gem is teardrop-shaped about the size of a pinto bean . Park interpreter said it 's the largest of the 122 diamonds found this year .
-----------------------------------------------
An Arkansas woman became a little richer this week after finding a large diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park.

Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, found the 3.69-carat white diamond in a 37.5-acre search field on Thursday, her last day of a trip to the park with her husband.  

Clark, who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother and grandmother, prayed to God, asking, 'Are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today?' as she searched the field. 

Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas

Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something 

And shortly after praying, Clark said she spotted the diamond sticking out of a ridge of plowed dirt, according to Region 8. 

She named the teardrop-shaped diamond the Hallelujah Diamond, claiming that her prayer helped her find the gem. 

Clark plans to keep the pinto-sized diamond, which is the largest diamond of the 122 found in the park this year. 

Crater of Diamonds State Park holds the only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public, in the form of a large plowed search field. 

'The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent metallic shine,' park interpreter Waymon Cox told Region 8. 'It's the largest one found since April 16, 2014.'

The search field had just been plowed earlier in the week because the park had seen a lot of rain, Cox said.   

'This regular endeavor loosens the diamond-bearing soil which, along with rain erosion, brings more diamonds to the surface and helps park visitors' chances of finding them,' he said.

Cox added: 'With all the rain we've been seeing, along with this week's plowing, there's a good chance more diamonds will be found on the surface in the days to come.'

Novak Djokovic beat John Isner 7-6 . 6-2 in their Miami semi-final . The world No 1 will take on Andy Murray in Sunday 's final . Djokovic is bidding to win his fifth title at Key Biscayne .
-----------------------------------------------
Two hours before the Miami Open semifinal, Novak Djokovic practiced his returns in an empty stadium, the ball coming at him quickly because his hitting partner stood three feet inside the baseline to emulate big-serving John Isner.

The drill helped. Djokovic achieved a breakthrough service break against Isner and won Friday night, 7-6 (3), 6-2.

'He's probably the best server we have in the game,' Djokovic said. 'But I managed to get a lot of serves back. That was one of the keys in the match, making him play and getting into the rally and making him work extra.'

Novak Djokovic beat John Isner in straight sets to reach the finalof the Miami Open on Friday night

The No 1-seeded Djokovic closed to within one win of his fifth Key Biscayne title and will face Andy Murray

The No 1-seeded Djokovic closed to within one win of his fifth Key Biscayne title. His opponent Sunday will be two-time champion Andy Murray, who defeated Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-4.

Djokovic became the first player in the tournament to break Isner, and managed another break two games later. He actually outserved the 6-foot-10 American, totaling 10 aces to nine for Isner, and never faced a break point.

A taut, one-hour opening set created plenty of drama for the capacity crowd. Isner held despite several long service games and erased the only break point he faced late in the set, but he won only two of five points on his serve in the pivotal tiebreaker.

Djokovic's biggest hole while serving was a love-30 deficit late in the first set. He responded with consecutive aces and escaped.

Djokovic is aiming to win his fifth title in Miami and will take on Scotsman Murray in Sunday's final

Djokovic's first break gave him a 2-1 edge in the second set, and that margin grew to 5-1. He finished with just eight unforced to 31 by Isner, who lost 70 percent of his second-serve points.

'I needed to step in and use those opportunities,' Djokovic said. 'When I have his second serve, I'd better use it properly and try to be aggressive.'

Djokovic won the Key Biscayne title in 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Serena Williams bids for her eighth Key Biscayne title Saturday against Carla Suarez Navarro.

Djokovic's biggest holin serving was a love-30 deficit late in the first, he responded with consecutive aces 

Murray lost his first service game in each set but recovered and moved closer to his third Key Biscayne title by beating Berdych. Murray won the championship in 2009 and 2013, and was the runner-up in 2012.

The Scotsman has a home in nearby Miami and practices on the Key Biscayne courts.

'I've obviously played some good tennis here over the years,' Murray said. 'The reason for that is because I'm extremely familiar with the conditions, with the surface, the way the court plays.'

Aside from his two shaky service games, the No. 3-seeded Murray played almost flawless tennis against No. 8 Berdych, extending points with scrambling defense until the Czech would finally make a mistake.

Djokovic won the Key Biscayne title in 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2014 and is now going for his sixth Miami crown

Murray, by contrast, totaled only eight unforced errors from the baseline. He improvised, too, winning points with unorthodox strokes requiring compound adjectives, such as a running shoetop-scoop lob and an underhand-swipe backhand drop shot.

Murray fell behind love-30 serving in the final game but rallied and smacked winners on the final four points, including a nifty forehand volley and cross-court backhand. When a final forehand gave him the win, he screamed in jubilation and repeatedly pumped his arm like a piston.

'I just played a bit better than him. That was the difference,' Murray said. 'When I was behind in games, like the last game, for example, I came up with some big serves and was able to dictate a lot of the rallies from the baseline.'

The final is Murray's first since he was runner-up to Djokovic at the Australian Open on February 1

The final is Murray's first since he was runner-up to Djokovic at the Australian Open on February 1, and his first in two years at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament. He's 9-3 in Masters 1000 finals.

Murray improved to 6-6 against Berdych and has won their past two matches.

'Andy changed the game plan a bit,' Berdych said. 'He started to play much more aggressive in the last two matches that he played me. Now I know what to expect and I'll just be more ready for it.'

Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams . Scientists now believe a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks . The same skeptics also warn of the health risks associated with consuming less than 3,000 milligrams . Average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day .
-----------------------------------------------
For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt

For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt.

Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year.

As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk.

The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50.

In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 

'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine.

'So why are we still scaring people about salt?'

While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much.

The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves.

Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure

Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks.

The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks.

The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble.

They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels.

Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement.

'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.'

But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.

-----------------------------------------------
Adrian Heath is holding court at his weekly pre-match press conference, and one of the local reporters wants to talk crossbars.

Might it be a good idea to raise it a bit so more goals could be scored for the benefit of goal-hungry American fans? The well-travelled former Everton and Manchester City midfielder – now manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City – responds with good humour.

'Well, soccer's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it's still doing quite well, so I don't really see a need,' he replies with a patient smile.

Adrian Heath is manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City

Such inquiries are actually becoming fewer and further between, as the world game and the huge US market get better acquainted with each other.

Heath has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand, going from the backwoods of the USL to the major leagues that Orlando have been elevated to this season.

The years have not dimmed Heath's impish enthusiasm and, now 53, he speaks of the game's expansion with an almost missionary zeal. Perched in the morning sunshine on a bench at City's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps, what Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard can expect, the humility of his star signing Kaka and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with David Beckham's troubled Miami project.

Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in the summer after spending 17 seasons at Liverpool

Midfielder Frank Lampard has signed a two-year contract with New York City

The aforementioned names' imminent arrival is just one reason why the MLS is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the Atlantic.

' I think English people are fascinated with America,' says Heath. ' You see the baseball, American football and basketball and wonder whether football can take off here. I'm glad to say I think the only question is how big it becomes.

'Perhaps we have slowly had to educate some of the media. One of the things that has kept football down a bit is that some of the high profile media haven't known the sport, and maybe some people are scared of it. They guard their own sports quite carefully.'

Heath's Stateside adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native Newcastle Under Lyme, where he bumped into Stoke City director Phil Rawlins.

Kaka is playing out the final days of a distinguished career on the doorstep of Disney World

'He was looking to invest in soccer over here and I had just lost my job at Coventry. I'd been with Coventry to Portland that year for a pre-season friendly and there were 15,000 people there. I thought the game was taking off and so I thought I'd try and get in early.

'I started off at the bottom in the USL in Austin, Texas. Sometimes there were less than 1,000 people in the ground, not great facilities, lot of college kids, but you could see the game growing.

'Now you look at Seattle Sounders and they would be not that far from Man United and Arsenal in average gates, getting 45,000 per game.'

His belief that in ten years the MLS will be world's 'third or fourth biggest league' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails: ' I only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here. All the time agents are offering me players who are going to be out of contract in two years' time, big international players who will may be be 29 then.'

Orlando midfielder Kaka has the highest salary in MLS history

While Beckham is still looking for a ground in Miami – last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue – Orlando sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the Citrus Bowl.

'We got 62,000 our first game. That will not be sustained but we are building a 21,000 seater stadium with the capability of going up to 28,000 and we will fill that.'

It helps having Kaka as the club's marquee signing, a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour, as Heath quickly discovered: 'We went on pre-season to Charleston and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around. He volunteered to drive one of them and then would wait around for the kids who are straggling and the last to leave, to make sure they're not left behind. He's a remarkable person.'

He knows what an impact the involvement of Beckham could also have if he can sort problems out 250 miles south, and admits a vested interest:' I think he has faced an uphill battle on the back of what happened with the baseball there. The city invested millions into the Marlins and they weren't happy with how it worked out with the owner.

Midfielder Heath scored 71 goals in 226 games for Everton

'There's nobody at this club that doesn't want to see David get it off the ground in Miami. Rivalry makes sports, and we could get that going with Miami and maybe Atlanta, which is also a few hours up the road.

' I think David will do it there, it's very difficult for a city to turn down a major league sport over here with all that it brings. One of things that has helped in Orlando is that it's a young city and they want to show it has a lot more to offer than Disney. The city has united behind this.'

Gerrard and Lampard will be coming sooner and, he says, there will be a few culture shocks. ' They will have to get used to the travel for an away game. Six hour flights leaving on Thursday and not arriving back until Sunday night. The time difference, sleep patterns.

'I think they'll be impressed with the athleticism in the league. Six years ago coming here in your mid thirties you could get away with coasting but those days are gone. Frank will be fine and so will Steven because they've got great football brains.'

Heath helped Everton lift eight trophies during his six years at Goodison Park

And they will find a much more level playing field.'The great thing about the MLS is because of the salary cap there is parity and you don't know who is going to win the league. The Premier League is exciting in many ways but you know only three or four teams can win it.

' Nobody is more patriotic than me and I'm very proud to have played for the likes of Everton and Man City. But the thought that Everton might never win another trophy doesn't sit well with me. They were level five years ago with Man City. It's unthinkable that Everton might not win anything again.'

Heath is that rare bird in English football, the traveller, having also spent a season at Espanyol as a player. It has made him a better coach, although he admits his Spanish excursion was not about self-improvement.

'I earned more money going to Spain, one of the reasons we don't export any more from England is that we are the gravy train. If you want to earn a lot of money you stay in England. If you go back to the likes of me, Mark Hateley, Glenn Hoddle, Michael Robinson, the truth is we all went for more money. But it does help you learn.'

Now he is doing something very unusual, having to effectively build a team from scratch after Orlando's 'promotion', working all the time within the salary cap. They currently lie third in the Eastern Conference after six games.

'The bottom line is we have got just under 4 million pounds to work with for 28 players (one of them is his son Harrison). You get three of them outside the wage cap but they count as 400 each against it so there is a lot of juggling.'

Heath never gets homesick, and there is a constant flow of football people passing through from England, usually taking their children to Disneyland.

'The funny thing is that is brought my kids over quite a few times when I was a player and they were younger, but now I'm working here I've never set foot in the place.'

Thabo Sefolosha says he `` experienced a significant injury and ... the injury was caused by the police '' He and teammate Pero Antic were arrested near the scene of a stabbing early April 8 . They were not involved in the stabbing police said , but they were arrested for obstruction , other charges .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)NBA player Thabo Sefolosha says police caused his season-ending leg injury when he was arrested last week after leaving a nightclub in New York.

In a statement Tuesday, the guard/forward for the Atlanta Hawks described his injury as "significant," and said it "was caused by the police."

Sefolosha suffered a fractured fibula and ligament damage when he and teammate Pero Antic were arrested near the scene of the stabbing of Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland and two other women early April 8. Police said Sefolosha and Antic were not involved in the stabbing incident, but they were charged with misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration.

TMZ Sports released video last week that shows a group of police officers arresting the 6-foot-7 Sefolosha and taking him to the ground. It also shows an officer within that group getting out a baton and extending it near him, but what may have caused the injury is not clear in the video. Sefolosha appears to be limping as he is led away by officers.

New York Police Department Sgt. Daniel Doody said Wednesday that the matter is being reviewed by the Internal Affairs Bureau and would not comment further. Internal Affairs had no comment.

Sefolosha did not specify his injury in his statement Tuesday, but the Hawks said last week that he has a fractured fibula and ligament damage, will undergo surgery and will miss the rest of the season, including the playoffs, which begin this weekend. The Hawks enter as the top seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference.

Sefolosha, who turns 31 in May, is in his ninth NBA season and his first with the Hawks. He averaged 5.3 points per game this season.

"I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to join my teammates on the court during the playoffs and apologize to them for any distraction this incident has caused," Sefolosha said in his statement. "I will be cheering for them every step of the way and will be diligent in my rehabilitation.

"On advice of counsel, I hope you can appreciate that I cannot discuss the facts of the case. Those questions will be answered by my attorney in a court of law. I will simply say that I am in great pain, have experienced a significant injury and that the injury was caused by the police."

Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said in a statement last week, "This is a very difficult situation for Thabo and our thoughts and support will be with him during his recovery. We know that his approach and dedication will serve him well in his rehabilitation. Our team remains focused and will be prepared as we head into the postseason."

Antic, a 31-year-old, 6-foot-11 center/forward, missed the April 8 game against the Brooklyn Nets, but has played since then.

In a joint statement last week, Sefolosha and Antic said they will contest the charges.

According to the Pacers, Copeland underwent surgery on his abdomen and left elbow for stab wounds. He was released from the hospital two days after the incident, according to Bleacher Report.

The Pacers, with one regular-season game left, are trying to secure the last spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. If they do, their first-round opponent would be Atlanta.

CNN's Camille Cava contributed to this report.

A 1,200lb-man forced to move from his financially-troubled nursing home was hoisted from the building by a crane and driven to his new residence on a flatbed truck.

Robert Butler, 43, was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston. He was accompanied by his medical team. 

The operation took almost seven hours on Sunday and involved the Providence and Cranston fire departments, Lifespan, the Hospital Association of Rhode Island and Bay Crane Northeast.

Robert Butler was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston on Sunday after his nursing home shut down amid financial difficulties. In this 2009 image, he weighed 900lbs. He has since gained another 300lbs

The Rhode Island health department acquired a crane from Bay Crane Northeast to help with their operation 

Mr Butler was moved to his new hospital resident in a shipping container alongside his medical team to monitor his health

According to Target 12, the complex operation began with firefighters widening the door of Butler's room, then building a special ramp to move Mr Butler on to a deck.

He was then shifted into the shipping container, complete with medical equipment, and lifted with a crane down on to a flatbed truck.    

Michael Raia of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health & Human Services said planning for the move began weeks ago. 

Mr Raia said the new facility is better equipped to help Butler.

In 2006, Mr Butler, who is on permanent disability, told local news channels that his bed was broken  at the nursing home and he was not receiving proper care. 

At the time, he weighed 900lbs and was trying to find a doctor to perform a gastric bypass and a way to cover the cost of the medical bills. 

He told WPRI that his weight problem was linked to his depression and that he was addicted to food. 

The crane was used to hoist Mr Butler in a medically-equipped shipping container from the nursing home on to a flatbed truck on Sunday afternoon 

Mr Butler weighs around 1,200lb after a decade of battling his weight which he linked to depression

Mr Butler said in an interview in 2006 (pictured) that he was desperate for a gastric bypass but was unable to find a doctor to perform the surgery. At the time he weight 900lb

Southampton have seen several of their best players leave in recent years . Nathaniel Clyne looks set to be the next to move on from St Mary 's . Manchester United have been linked with a move for the right back . Saints boss Ronald Koeman admits it will be difficult to keep him .
-----------------------------------------------
Southampton manager Ronald Koeman accepts it will be difficult to keep hold of Nathaniel Clyne this summer as Manchester United prepare a bid for England's first-choice right back.

An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season.

Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead.

Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton

Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League.

Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay.

'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said.

'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong.

'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest.

'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club.

Clyne made his full England debut last November

'We need understanding for that but nothing else.

'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities.

'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.'

Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign.

'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said.

'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on.

'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.'

Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull.

Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez.

It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City.

There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week.

'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them.

'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club.

Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool

Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence

'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.'

Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future.

Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned.

But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager.

'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'

Beijing (CNN)Chinese police on Monday released five female activists who were detained last month, family and friends of the women tell CNN.

Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Zheng Churan, Li Tingting and Wu Rongrong were freed.

The women will be under police surveillance for a year and have their movements and activities restricted, attorney Liang Xiaojun said. Police can summon the women for questioning at any time, he added.

The five members of China's Women's Rights Action Group were detained in Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou a few days before events planned for International Women's Day on March 8.

The United States had urged China to free them, and the international community harshly criticized keeping the women in custody.

"Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Friday. "We strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues, and we believe that Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them."

"Free the five" became a Twitter hashtag.

Wang Qiushi, a lawyer for Wei, said police recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of "assembling a crowd to disturb public order."

The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England 's title-decider against France .
-----------------------------------------------
Conor O’Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby’s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury.

Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free.

The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi.

Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month

Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st

‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch.

‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’

Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players.

George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps

‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live.

‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’

Gareth Blanks was beaten as he walked home from the shops in Truro . The 31-year-old has autism and police confirmed that he is vulnerable . Three men and a woman began punching and kicking him for no reason . Police believe that the four attackers are all in their late teens or early 20s .
-----------------------------------------------
Gareth Blanks was attacked as he walked back from the shops near his home in Truro, Cornwall, because he has autism and looks vulnerable 

A community is rallying around a defenceless man who was viciously beaten in a sustained and sickening attack by a gang of thugs - because he's autistic.

More than 1,500 people have come out in support of Gareth Blanks after the attack that saw him kicked and punched more than 20 times.

Mr Blanks, 31, was walking home after buying a chocolate bar when he was approached by a group of three men and one woman at around 8.30pm on April 17.

He was taunted by the group before snatching the hat from his head. When he tried to retrieve the garment,  he was pushed to the ground, and one of the males punched and kicked him 20 times in the head and across his body.

Mr Blanks is now recovering at his home in Truro, Cornwall, but his family say it will take him a long time to recover, and he has been left with deep mental scars.

An online support group called Support Gareth, which has already attracted over 1,500 likes on Facebook with several leaving messages of support.

His mother, Sandra, 54, who works as a dinner lady  said: 'He's still very distraught, he's shook up and it's going to take him some time before he can go out on his own again.

'They clearly targeted because of his condition. He does look vulnerable and walks around in his own little world. They didn't take anything about from his hat so their intention was clearly just to take the mickey out of him.

'When he came in, he was crying and really upset.

'As a mum, it was horrific to see. I am now just spending all my time trying to get my son sorted out.

'All the support he has got has been a tremendous help and we are so grateful.

'But this will take him a long time to get over. The physical scars will heal a lot quicker than the mental ones.'

Mrs Blanks, who has five children Kelly, 33, Samantha, 27, Lyndsey, 29, and Roy, 34, added: 'I really think need the people responsible need help themselves. There is a lot I would like to say about them - but I can't.

'I don't think they would have liked to have got the beating they gave to my son.'

Police are investigating the crime by pouring over CCTV footage, and are confident they will catch The attackers.

Mr Blanks, pictured, here with his sisters Kelly, left, and Lindsey, and mother Sandra, right, was 'hysterical' when he returned to his home in Truro in Cornwall following the attack on April 17 at 8.30pm 

His sister Kelly Blanks said: 'When he came home he was in a hysterical state and you couldn't get any sense out of him.'

Investigation office PC Kim James, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'It was a vicious and unprovoked attack by a female and three males in their late teens or early 20s.'

Sergeant Marc Sayers, from Truro police, said: 'This is clearly a cowardly attack on a vulnerably young man going about his normal business. It was almost pack activity.

'We take all attacks extremely seriously but this is exceptional, it was completely unwarranted and unprovoked.

'It also appears to have been quite a sustained attack on a male who was quite defenceless.'

Heathrow airport are threatening to strip Qantas of their eight valuable landing spots after they continually arrived late, according to internal memos.

The Australian airline could also be facing a massive £20,000 fine, that's more than AU$38,000, for every time the A380 flights set down more than fifteen late on the English tarmac.

Delayed: Qantas have been  told they could loose thier eight Heathrow landing strips after continuously arriving late to the busy airport

Fairfax published an internal a memo sent by Captain Martin Gardiner, manager of base operations at Sydney, that details the airlines failings while insisting can staff improve their waning performance.

'As a result of our performance, London airport has given Qantas an official warning; meaning that we could be fined £20,000 [$AU38,336] for each non-compliance of our slot time, or worse lose our slot.'

'We have been asked to advise Heathrow what our plans are to improve this performance. All areas of the business including flight operations are now monitoring the performance of these services very closely so that we can improve our performance and retain our landing slots in [London].'

Qantas have slipped to an on time ranking of 75 out of 80 airlines that use Heathrow airport

While Qantas' on time performance rating at Heathrow dropped to 75th out of 80 in the month of February, they are at serious risk of losing their landing spots at Heathrow before next flying season. 

Captain Gardiner reportedly said changes in flight times in the last 12 months had 'placed some additional stress on our network and turn-around times'. 

A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that there are a number of factors that can impact our arrival time into London and because of the way scheduling works, small delays on a long journey have a cumulative knock on affect.

'One of the biggest impacts is air traffic delays to get into Heathrow, which is a particular issue because we arrive at one of the most popular times and the airport is now at about 100 per cent capacity.'  

He said Qantas will be trying to increase the speed of A380 flights to ensure they make it to Heathrow in time.  

A Qantas spokesperson said air congestion at Heathrow and Dubai were to blame for the late arrivals

Atheist writer David Fitzgerald claims there is no evidence Jesus existed . The San Francisco based author instead says Jesus was a literary allegory created by combining old Jewish stories and rituals along with rival cults . He insists it is time to stop believing in Jesus Christ as a historical figure .
-----------------------------------------------
Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist.

David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist.

He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear.

Scroll down for video 

Mystery: This painting depicts Jesus Christ as single person but writer David Fitzgerald believes he was a literary invention that combined the stories from several cults and figures in Judea during the first century

He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus.

Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence.

Historical researcher Michael Paulkovich has claimed that Jesus of Nazareth did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of Christ in historical texts by 126 writers during the ‘time of Jesus’ from the first to third centuries.

He claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of Christianity to create a figure to worship.

He says this is surprising despite his ‘global miracles and alleged worldwide fame.’ 

The 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of Jesus, when Paulkovich says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as Jesus - but none mention him.

'When I consider those 126 writers, all of whom should have heard of Jesus but did not - and Paul and Marcion and Athenagoras and Matthew with a tetralogy of opposing Christs, the silence from Qumram and Nazareth and Bethlehem, conflicting Bible stories, and so many other mysteries and omissions - I must conclude that Christ is a mythical character,’ he writes. 

‘"Jesus of Nazareth" was nothing more than urban (or desert) legend, likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed.’ 

In a new book due to be published later this year, he will argue that the figure of Jesus was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 

'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all.

'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray.

'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted.

'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. 

'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different "Lord's suppers" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs.

'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.'

Mr Fitzgerald, whose first book 'Nailed: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed at All' was published in 2010, believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began Christianity.

Instead he says early Christians drew upon the beliefs and rituals of other cults and faiths around in the first century.

He argues that John the Baptist's cult is one such example and had initially been a competitor to the cult of Jesus before being incorporated into the Christian story.

Mr Fitzgerald says there are inconsistencies in the Gospels of the Christian bible (pictured above) that suggest Jesus Christ was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life

The statue of Christ the Redeemer (above) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is one of many depictions of Jesus but Mr Fitzgerald says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance

Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all.

'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria.

'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record.

'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.'

The earliest mention of Jesus yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' is inscribed.

The box, which has been dated to 64AD - several decades after the crucifixion - was seized by the Israeli Antiquities Authority and its owner arrested for forgery in 2003.

Although he was later cleared in 2012, doubts about the authenticity of the inscription remain. 

Others have said there could have been several people named James, whose father was called Joseph and had a brother called Jesus living in Jerusalem at the time.

The James Ossuary (above) is thought by some to be the first mention of Jesus in an inscription on its side

There are three mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources which have been used to research the existence of a 'real' Jesus.

A Jesus is mentioned in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which was written around 94 AD.

Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect.

This claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus' life, when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea.

The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience.

Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background.

He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character.

Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son. 

Roman historian Tacitus later mentions Christ and his execution with Pontius Pilate in his Annals, thought to be written around 116AD.

Both mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution.

Mr Fritzgerald also takes issue with many of the stories about the Crucifixion that stem from the first Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke.

He said: 'There are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in Judea at the time they are set.

'Mark makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in Judea.

'If Jesus really had been arrested on the eve of Passover, they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend.

'The trial itself violates the rules of Jewish law - why was he not stoned?

'What we know about Pontius Pilate also suggests he was someone who would not do what the Jews asked him and would often do what they asked him not to. 

'Instead Mark portrays him as being persuaded by the Jewish leaders to execute him.'

Mr Fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of Christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account.

He said: 'There is also no evidence for the tradition that sees Barabbas - an anti-Roman rebel and murderer - being released while Jesus, an innocent, is condemned to death.

'What this actually seems to be is Mark using the story as an allegory for the Yom Kippur scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for God.'

Mr Fitzgerald hopes to have his new book 'Jesus: Mything in Action' out later this year.

He added: 'It still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who Jesus is we get 50 different Jesus's emerging. There is no consensus.'

Dr Sandra Lee is a dermatologist at the Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland , California , and is a regular guest on talk show The Doctors . Nearly 60,000 people subscribe to her YouTube channel , in which she shares videos of herself extracting her patients ' zits and cysts .
-----------------------------------------------
The cringeworthy, yet strangely addicting footage of whiteheads being popped, cysts being ruptured and blackheads being extracted has turned a dermatologist into an internet sensation as thousands of people flock to her video channel to catch a glimpse of 'Dr Pimple Popper' in action. 

Dr Sandra Lee is dermatologist at the Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and a regular guest on The Doctors talk show, but online she is known simply as Dr Pimple Popper, a moniker she used when she started posting clips of her patients' extractions on her YouTube channel. The clips have earned her nearly 60,000 subscribers, as well as loyal fan base of zit squeezing enthusiasts on Reddit.

'I find this little subculture fascinating,' Dr Lee told Racked of her followers. 'I pop these things, and yeah they kind of make me feel good, they’re satisfying, but it’s not like I seek them out.'

All in a day's work: Dermatologist Dr Sandra Lee, who known as Dr Pimple Popper online, shares videos of herself extracting her patients zits on her popular YouTube channel 

Day job: Dr Lee, from Upland, California, can be seen using a comedone extractor to pop one of her patient's blemishes 

Dr Lee explained that when a patient comes in she offers to tackle their blemishes in exchange for them allowing her to post the videos of the process online, while keeping the clips as anonymous as she can.

And she noted that, despite the somewhat gruesome nature of her YouTube channel, 'nobody ever says no'.

Before she shot to internet fame, Dr Lee's channel, used to only feature a selection of TV segments that she had done, only had a few thousand followers. However, when she joined Instagram, she started posting short clips of her actually treating patients, a decision which quickly garnered her much more interest, prompting her to start putting full-length clips up on YouTube, starting with a video of her extracting a man's blackheads. 

'I didn’t realize how big it would be,' she said of the video, which has received more than 360,000 views since it was posted in December.

Dr Lee explained that she was such an 'amateur' at the time; she barely knew anything about Reddit and was 'floored' when she learned that her video was being shared on a popular pimple popping subreddit. The experience opened her eyes to an entire community that she had no idea existed.

The doctor, who is now well-known on the subreddit, said the people are 'really wonderful'.

Big break: Dr Lee became an internet sensations after she posted this video of herself extracting a man's blackheads on YouTube. The clips was later shared on Reddit and helped her to earn a loyal fan base

But Dr Lee questions whether she is a 'true popper' because she doesn't actually enjoy watching people squeeze and poke their whiteheads and cysts on their own.

'I don’t watch any of the other videos,' she said. 'They all kind of gross me out! When they’re amateur, I don’t want to hear screaming, I don’t like that stuff.'

But pimple popping has quickly become a key part of Dr Lee's occupation. In fact, it's basically the family business; both her father and her husband are dermatologists as well. 

According to Dr Lee the most popular types of popping are the extractions of blackheads and whiteheads, and she has now come to learn that there are two different varieties of video – ‘a soft pop and a hard pop'. 

'Some people just like blackheads, it’s like soft porn, a soft pop,' she noted. 'And then there’s a hard pop, where people like more of a cyst.'

In March, Dr Lee posted a 'best of soft pop' video montage has been viewed more than 500,000 since it was posted last month.

'I've been listening to you guys, and I hear that there are two general groups of you PimplePoppaholics: Some like the SoftPop, some prefer the HardPop!' she wrote in the description. 'Of course, some of you like it all, but I thought I would try to make as many of you happy as I can. Here's a Soft Pop Best Of... I'll have a HardPop Best Of later today for you. Enjoy! [sic]' 

Free time: The dermatologist, pictured in a selfie posted on her Instagram account, is now well-known among the pimple popping community on Reddit

Basic extraction: Dr Lee said videos of blackheads and whiteheads being removed (pictured) are most popular 

And many commenters lauded Dr Lee for her rapport with her patients.

Dr Lee, who uses her iPhone and iMovie to shoot and edit the videos, told Racked that she likes to show the 'human side' of her patients by having them share their back story. 

She said that her favorite clips are of a patient she calls 'Pop', who recently lost his wife to a 'chronic, painful sickness'.  

'What's amazing is that what started as a video of my squeezing the blackheads on his nose has transformed into the wonderful feel-good human interest story,' she told Daily Mail Online. 

She continued: 'They were inseparable, and he has had trouble adjusting to his new life in an assisted living facility. He has both financial and emotional stress, and he tells a little of his story in his videos.'

After hearing Pop's struggles, Dr Lee's YouTube and Reddit followers asked her to start him a GoFundMe page so they could help him financially.

The page, which was started on April 15, has already already exceeded its $5,000 goal - raising $5,665 in just eight days. 

Family business: Dr Lee can be seen with her husband Dr Jeffrey Rebish, who is also a dermatologist 

Addicting videos: Dr Lee can be seen extracting a blackhead from one of her patients 

'He knows a little about what is going on, but doesn't know yet how much people have donated to help him out in his current situation,' she explained. 'He would be shocked to hear that well wishes are coming from all over the world.'

One commenter who made a donation noted: 'This gentleman reminds me of my grandpa. I wish him all the best, he is such a gentle soul. Lots of love from a French girl in the UK x [sic].'

Dr Lee said she plans on visiting him in his new home and present him with all the cards, messages and money that people have given him next week. 

'I can't wait to see how surprised and touched he will be,' she said.

As for her extraction technique, Dr Lee told Racked that it's 'not completely sterile', but she uses clean gloves and a comedone extractor, which she said costs less than $20. Although she warned that people shouldn't pop their pimples because they can risk scarring, she admitted that she is guilty of squeezing her own zits at home.

For people who absolutely have to pick, Dr Lee advised them to use a warm compress and prick the blemish with a sterile needle when it comes to a head. But she he added that she can't ensure anyone that they aren't going to scar when they take matters into their own hands.

Dr Lee, who is also a skin cancer surgeon and a cosmetic surgeon, explained that she has posted videos of her doing other procedures, but people aren't as interested in them.

'People might construe that I’m addicted to this stuff, but I’m not,' she said of work as Dr Pimple Popper. 'This isn’t everything that I do. In fact, it’s a very small part.'

Funeral strippers in rural China are the latest focus of the country 's crackdown on vice . In some areas of China , the hiring of professional mourners is commonplace , but some performances are getting racy . Government report says that stripteases undermine `` the cultural value of the entertainment business ''
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)If you were mourning the loss of a loved one in China, at least the entertainment might have cheered you up. Until now.

In rural China, hiring exotic dancers to perform at wakes is an increasingly common practice, but is now the latest focus of the country's crackdown on vice.

Strippers are invited to perform at funerals, often at great expense, to attract more mourners, China's official Xinhua news agency said.

Another report suggested another motivation: that the performances "add to the fun."

Photos obtained by CNN from an attendee at a village funeral in Cheng'an County in Hebei Province show mourners of all ages, including children, watching the performance.

The attendee, who asked not to be identified, said he was visiting family during the Lunar New Year holiday. While he was there, one of the elderly villagers died so he went to the funeral.

"I felt something wasn't right," he told CNN. "The performance crossed the line. I had heard about hiring strippers to dance at funerals but had never seen it myself. I was shocked when I saw the strippers."

He said the villagers said this kind of performance had been practiced for a while.

"They didn't find it shocking or strange. They were used to it.

"They told me, 'what if we can't watch (this kind of) performance after it gets exposed by the media?'"

In some areas of China, the hiring of professional mourners, known as "kusangren" is commonplace. These can include performances, although in recent times the dance acts have increasingly tended towards the erotic.

China's Ministry of Culture issued a statement Thursday announcing a crackdown on these funeral stripteases.

It said that the ministry had investigated two separate incidents, one in Handan City, Hebei Province, and the other in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province. Both involved multiple-participant "burlesque" and "striptease" shows as mourners looked on.

The Ministry's report said that stripteases undermined "the cultural value of the entertainment business," and asserted that "such acts were uncivilized."

The practice has been going on for some time, the report said. Exotic dancing and other forms of pornography are illegal in China. The dancers in the two cases were held in "administrative detention" following the two investigations, the report added.

The Ministry of Culture did not respond to CNN requests for comment.

Last year, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security ordered police across China to step up efforts to tackle the "three vices" -- prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking -- warning officials they would be held accountable for illegal activities.

In February 2014, a massive crackdown on prostitution in the southern manufacturing city of Dongguan, dubbed "Sin City" for its huge vice industry, raided 2,000 establishments and detained more than 900 people.

Ed Miliband bored his future wife Justine on their first meeting at a party . The Labour leader discussed economics when she had little interest . He then failed to tell her that he was going out with the dinner party 's host . Mrs Miliband said she and her husband are not interested in ` kitchengate '
-----------------------------------------------
Justine Miliband fell in love with her husband Ed after she was attacked by a Doberman while canvassing on his behalf - even though she had been 'furious' with him after a bungled first date.

Mrs Miliband, 44, has revealed that she first met the Labour leader at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend and thought he was 'good looking' and 'unattached'.

But the Labour leader failed to tell his future wife that he was secretly going out with their 'mutual friend' - understood to be the former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders.

Worse still, the politician persisted in trying to bore his future wife with constant talk of economics, which she can't stand.

Justine Miliband, right, said she fell in love with her husband Ed, left, after she got bitten by a dog 

Mrs Miliband, right, said Ed, left, did not tell her that he was in a relationship when they first met at a party

The mother-of-two was campaigning with her husband in the north west at several events. 

In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Mrs Miliband said: 'Canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with Ed in 2005. 

'I had never been out leafleting before and didn't realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox.

'I'd been bitten by a Doberman. Ed bandaged me up and I fell in love with him.'

The Doberman incident happened while canvassing in Mr Miliband's constituency in Doncaster. 

However, Mr Miliband almost doomed the couple's relationship on their first encounter after he failed to reveal that he was already in a relationship. 

She said: 'I thought he was good looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversational cul-de-sac.

'Apparently we had nothing in common. He wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.'

The unpromising start to their relationship was compounded when she found out he had been going out with the woman who invited them to dinner. 

She said: 'I found out he was secretly going out with the woman who had invited us for dinner. I was furious.

'I bumped into him a couple of times after that, but we didn’t start seeing each other for at least a year.' 

Mrs Miliband said she first met the Labour leader at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend - understood to be the former BBC economics editor - who Ed was secretly in a relationship with

Mrs Miliband said neither her or her husband are bothered about the 'kitchengate' controversy when it emerged the couple had two kitchens - or 'bacongate' when Mr Miliband was caught struggling to each a sandwich

The couple have two children, Daniel and Samuel.

However, Mrs Miliband, who is a lawyer, said she has no intention of giving up her job in the event her husband is elected prime minister.

She said she was 'genuinely taken aback' by the suggestion. 

Mrs Miliband said she has been surprised by some people's obsession with their domestic arrangements.

She added: 'With kitchengate, I was just amazed at the ink being spilled. I can't get upset about things like that when people are having terrible lives in this country and around the world. 

'There are things in politics that are really serious and then there's lots of other stuff. It's partly why Ed and I get on so well. Both of us couldn't care less about kitchengate or bacon buttygate.'

Carlos Boente , 33 , was serving time in prison for harassment-type offences . He began contacting the victim after receiving her number from a cellmate . She spoke to him out of sympathy , but the messages turned threatening . He started telling her she was going to die and threatening her child .
-----------------------------------------------
Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge

A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate.

Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013.

After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour.

He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison.

The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply.

She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door.

In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child.

Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'.

Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year.

He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1.

Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive.

'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct.

'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe.

'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary.

Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman

'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women.

'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences.

'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour.

'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life.

'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

15 buffalo are shot on Friday after escaping the day before from a farm in Schodack , New York . Police helicopters fly overhead and nearby schools put on alert in the final moments of the chase . The herd breaks through three layers of barbed wire fencing and crosses the Hudson River during the escape .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Fifteen buffalo were shot and killed on Friday after a day on the loose in upstate New York.

The chase, which took farmers and police officers from five jurisdictions through forests and over the Hudson River, ended with "snipers" from the animals' farm gunning down the buffalo from the side of the road, according to Lt. Thomas Heffernan of the Bethlehem Police Department.

"It was turning into the wild, wild, West," Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple told reporters on Friday. "It was time to put an end to it."

Heffernan described the hectic last moments of the chase:

"They were setting up a perimeter around the animals in the secluded area, they got spooked and they charged through our guys," Heffernan said.

The herd then stampeded across the interstate highway, breaking through a wire fence.

"Once they crossed over the freeway, that really escalated it," Heffernan said. "There was no choice; the animals had to be destroyed."

The bull of the heard weighed over 1,300 pounds and a collision with a car could easily have been fatal, Heffernan said.

New York State Police helicopters were called in and nearby school districts were alerted to keep all students inside, Heffernan said.

Four men from GEM Farms in Schodack, New York, from where the buffalo escaped, were on the scene by a ravine in Coeymans, New York, to kill the animals, a decision Heffernan said wasn't made lightly, but that was necessary.

George Mesick, the 87-year-old owner of the farm, sat in the car listening to the radio as his buffalo were shot.

"Very sad," Mesick said. "I'm just so glad that they got them before somebody got hurt."

Twenty-two buffalo escaped from the farm on Thursday -- half the farm's stock -- including six that were shot Thursday night in Rensselaer County, Mesick said.

One buffalo calf was found dead on a road, hit, and not reported, by a driver, Mesick said.

Mesick has been raising buffalo for their meat since 1973, he said, with no escape like this before.

"They love to roam," he said. "They love to get in the big field and go like a son of a gun and that's what they did yesterday."

The last buffalo were shot 20 miles from the farm, he said.

The herd broke through three strands of high tensile barbed wire to escape the farm, and later swam across the Hudson River, according to Mesick, still surprised.

"They never even had a pond to swim across," Mesick said. "I still can't believe it."

-----------------------------------------------
A British marathon runner has become the first blind athlete to complete the 'toughest footrace on Earth', which saw him run almost 160 miles across the Sahara Desert. 

Dave Heeley, 57, from West Bromwich, ran the gruelling challenge over six days as he battled through sand dunes, dried river beds and rocks.

The super-fit father-of-three, known affectionately by his friends as 'Blind Dave', took part in the Marathon des Sables where competitors carry provisions on their backs and temperatures can rise to 50 degrees.

Mr Heeley - who became the first blind man to run seven marathons on seven continents in 2008 - set off on April 5 and hopes to raise more than £30,000 for charity. 

He was joined by two guides and friends Rosemary Rhodes and Tony Ellis. 

The 57-year-old crossed the finish line on Friday after running 156 miles and camping in the desert. 

Tough: In the Marathon des Sables, athletes have to carry their provisions on their back and sleep in tents

Rocky: Mr Heeley struggled with the terrain as he hadn't done any mountain climbing, but still finished the race

Completed: Mr Heeley finished the 'toughest foot race on Earth' on Friday after running almost 160 miles 

The Marathon des Sables translates into English as Marathon of the Sands.

It was started in 1986 by Patrick Bauer - a French concert promoter.

The course is about 156 miles, the equivalent of six regular marathons. It is a six day race and there is only one rest day. 

Competitors must carry all their provisions for the whole race on their back.

Temperatures in the desert can reach 50 degrees during the day and more than 40 per cent humidity, while dropping to below freezing at night time

Other famous Britons to compete include rower James Cracknell.

His wife, Debbie, 48, said: 'The terrain was something that he did not know how to manage. 

'The team hadn't done any mountain climbing in their training. 

'It took them a bit longer than he expected as a result. They were eight or nine hour days running in that heat. 

'It was sweltering and he also had to go through sandstorms. The conditions were difficult.'

She added: 'They had to do 56.5 miles straight and run through the night at one stage. 

'They had to go up a big hill at that part and going down can be just as bad, especially if you can't see.

'I am very proud. It is certainly a tough challenge.

'He has done a number of difficult challenges in the past but this tops it. I am very pleased for him.' 

Mr Heeley has been raising money for the Albion Foundation, a charity that works in partnership with his beloved West Bromwich Albion FC to use sport as a way to benefit the community. 

So far, he has raised £20,000 but hopes to reach a further £10,000. 

Resting up: Mr Heeley ran through the Sahara Desert and then had to sleep in his tent and make his own food

In 2008, the father-of-three completed the Seven Magnificent Marathons challenge which saw him finish seven marathons in a week on seven continents. 

His route took him from Port Stanley, Falkland Islands (Antarctica), to Santiago, Chile (South America), Los Angeles, USA (North America), Sydney, Australia (Australasia), Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Asia), Nairobi, Kenya (Africa), before finishing with the London Marathon. 

In another record breaking achievement, explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes became the oldest Briton to finish the Marathon des Sables when he completed this year's course at the age of 71.

St. Louis Blues forward Ryan Reaves proved on Sunday that hockey players truly are some of the toughest men in sports. 

After being checked face-first into the glass by Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook, Reaves went to the bench and pulled out his own tooth. 

Reaves calmly digs around his mouth until he grabs the loose tooth, pulls it out of his mouth and hands it to his trainer.

Reaves sat on the bench as he calmly pulled out the tooth. It eventually fell into his hand (pictured above) and he gave it to a team trainer

It is unknown as to what period the check occurred in or if Reaves returned to the ice, one tooth lighter. 

The St. Louis 2-1 win moved the team a point ahead of Nashville for the Central Division lead with just three games left in the season. 

Reaves isn't the only hockey player to make headlines for being tough in the last week, however. 

Prior to losing his tooth on Sunday, Reaves, pictured here April 3, appeared to have a full mouth of perfectly straight pearly whites, something that's a bit unusual in the hockey world

Reaves and the rest of the Blues beat the Blackhawks 2-1 on Sunday, moving the team a point ahead of Nashville to the top of the Central Division standings

Red Wings left wing Drew Miller was hit in the face by Ottawa Senators forward Mark Stone's ice skate after a face off on March 31. 

the skate him him across his right cheekbone and he quickly skated off the ice to the on-scene doctor in fear that he might have lost his eye. 

He received between 50 and 60 stitches after the incident but the skate luckily missed his eye, according to MLive. 

Miller, who has the longest-running game attendance on the Red Wings team, returned to the ice for his 159th consecutive game with the team two days later on April 2 against the Boston Bruins.

The body of a New York woman was left dangling from a fire escape for more than an hour Sunday after she hung herself, police say.

The unnamed woman was discovered around 8.20am Sunday hanging from the third-floor fire escape of her apartment building on Utica Ave. near Prospect Place in Crown Heights, the New York Post reports.

One man, who declined to give his name, told the New York Daily news that he awoke to find the woman's body hanging outside his apartment. 

'I'm traumatized. We got up and she was dead,' he said. 'She hung herself outside my window.'

Witnesses say they were traumatized and one passer-by told the Post she initially thought the body was fake and believed it was a 'Halloween prank.'

The woman's identity has not been released pending notification of her family. 

One neighbor, 66-year-old Stella Wiley, who saw the woman walking her dog earlier in the day, described the woman as a 'very social, 'nice girl.'

Wiley noted that the woman had mental health issues and 'couldn't come out of that dark spot.' 

'It’s a terrible thing. Poor girl,' witness Horace Benoit, 38, told the Post. 'Her body was out there so long just hanging, it was like a horror movie.

The Ohio-based National School Safety and Security Services reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014-15 academic year . Researchers found that about one-third of cases involved violent remarks sent anonymously via text message , social media or other online means .

School safety experts have reported a 'worrying increase' in e-terrorism, where threats are sent electronically - sometimes from thousands of miles away. 

The Ohio-based National School Safety and Security Services reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014-15 academic year.

Researchers found that about one-third of cases involved violent remarks sent anonymously via text message, social media, email or other online means. 

Law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit.

Worrying trend: In this January 13, 2014 photo, students pass by Seven Lakes High School after being evacuated for the day after a bomb squad was called to remove a potentially explosive device 

In many cases, swift action is taken with lockdowns and evacuations. However, authorities say the majority of the time  threats turn out to be hoaxes.

Indeed, just this week a 16-year-old from Gateway High School in Kissimmee, Florida, was arrested for posting about a bomb threat on Twitter because 'she was angry and did not want to go to school,' according to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office.

Complicating matters, the threats aren't just coming from within school walls or even a school's neighborhood.

Last fall, Lakota Middle School in Federal Way, Washington, was placed in lockdown and police responded after an email purportedly from the Islamic State group demanded ransom money and threatened to 'shoot and kill' every American, according to a police report. 

A 14-year-old student was arrested after admitting the email had been sent by her online friend 'Ryan' after she told him to 'swat' her school because she thought it would be funny, police said.

'Swatting' plays off the idea of issuing a threat that draws a SWAT team in response, disrupting activities at the target of the threat. 

It appears to have originated with pranksters in the online gaming community.

In a separate case, a 14-year-old in western Michigan was ordered by a judge to pay nearly $8,000 in restitution to the Coopersville Area Public Schools and the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office for his involvement in a swatting incident that put schools in lockdown after a caller using computer-based technology made threats against the schools.

Authorities say the call was made by a person code-named 'Ransom,' whom the teen had met online. 

'Ransom' is believed to live in the UK and is suspected in a string of similar incidents from coast to coast, according to law enforcement.

'He will learn from this,' the teen's father said, according to the Grand Rapids Press in Michigan.

The motivations of the threat makers vary, just as they did a generation ago when bomb threats were called in by pay phone: avoiding a test, revenge or simply to show off. 

With swatting, a motivation appears to be thrill-seeking, said Capt. Mark Bennett with the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office.

It's not too difficult for students to figure out how to pull off such an incident, said Justin Cappos, a computer science professor at New York University who studies cybersecurity. 

'You wander to the wrong parts of the Internet and you can learn how to do it and not get caught,' Cappos said.

With each incident, there's a risk when authorities respond, said Detective Jerrad Ely, a digital forensics expert with the Mount Vernon Police Department in Washington who has been investigating a bomb threat case against a school in his community. 

'They could inadvertently get hurt when police are just trying to do their jobs based on the best information that they have,' he said.

Applications such as Burnbook, Afterschool, Yik Yak, Whisper and Kik also have been used by students to make threats anonymously.

In Michigan, Superintendent Timothy Stein of the Flushing Community Schools wrote to parents in December informing them about a posting on Afterschool that said, 'Bringing a Gun to School.' 

The posting had been brought to the high school principal's attention by a text message; police quickly determined that it was not a credible threat.

'I encourage you to ask you child to stop using this app and remove it from their phone,' Stein said.

Every threat has to be taken seriously even though in most cases the called-in danger is not real, said David Pennington, superintendent of schools in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and president of the AASA School Superintendents Association.

Meanwhile, social media and other electronic means of communication are keeping parents informed about threats. 

Mindful of past school shootings, they are demanding that children be pulled out of school even as school and law enforcement officials investigate.

'The security of people has been greatly eroded in this country, as you know, just through awful things that have happened,' said Mark Davidson, deputy superintendent at the Federal Way Public Schools.

Jamal al-Labani is believed to be the first American killed in current violence in Yemen . He was on his way back from mosque prayers when he was hit in the back by shrapnel , his family said . He went to Yemen in February in hopes of bringing his wife and baby back to the U.S.
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Jamal al-Labani had hoped to bring his pregnant wife and 2-year-daughter back to the United States from war-torn Yemen.

But the gas station owner never made it on a flight back to his home Hayward, California.

Family members have identified him as a victim killed in mortar strike last week in the southern Yemeni city of Aden.

He is believed to be the first U.S. citizen killed in the current violence in Yemen.

Early Tuesday evening, the 45-year-old al-Labani was on his way back from mosque prayers when he was hit in the back by shrapnel from a mortar shell, his family said. He died minutes later.

Violence quickly escalated in Yemen soon afer al-Labani arrived in February.

"When he got (to Aden), after a few weeks he noticed things were starting to get bad and then the (U.S.) Embassy closed," his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told CNN.

For the past three weeks, al-Labani had told family members he was concerned about not being able to evacuate as the situation deteriorated in the country, according to his cousin.

More than 200 people have been killed in Aden in the past 11 days, according to Naef Al Bakri, Aden's deputy governor.

Two days before al-Labani was killed, he told his family the last option was to try to cross the border into Oman and fly to Egypt, but he never made it.

"The airports got closed and things got worse and worse," Alazzani told CNN by phone. "People were hoping things would get better, but they only got worse and worse."

Yemen has been rocked by violence and political turmoil for months. Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, placing him under house arrest and taking over Sanaa, the country's capital.

Hadi escaped in February, fled to the southern city of Aden and said he remained President. He fled to Saudi Arabia last month as the rebels and their military allies advanced on Aden.

Now the violence is intensifying as Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations target the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes.

Yemeni-Americans are trapped in the conflict, but haven't gotten enough help from the U.S. government, the Council on American-Islamic Relations told CNN Sunday.

Zahra Billoo, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group, said it's helping al-Labani's family and the families of other Yemeni-Americans.

"All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp," Billoo said.

Responding to the criticism, the U.S. State Department told CNN that there are no current plans to evacuate private U.S. citizens from Yemen.

"We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available," a spokesman for the State Department told CNN in a statement. "Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others."

Yemeni-American advocates think more could be done.

"There have been travel warnings to Yemen for a few years now. What's not clear is, are they saying 'Be cautious' or 'Don't go at all'?" Billoo asked. "It still it doesn't sit well with many of us civil rights lawyers who believe that U.S. citizenship should be the ultimate protection."

Fierce fighting continued across Yemen on Sunday amid an electrical blackout in parts of the country and political moves that could further fracture the already divided military.

Intense airstrikes hit Sanaa overnight. Senior security officials in the Yemeni capital said the airstrikes targeted the military intelligence headquarters and the Defense Ministry's central command, military bases and missile depots.

The blasts at the military compounds, which are inside the city, shattered the windows of many homes nearby.

Meanwhile, some 16 million Yemenis living in provinces under control of Houthi rebels, including Sanaa, remained without power after an electrical blackout that began Saturday night.

In the country's south, the Houthis remain in control of Aden's port and other strategic holdings, including the state broadcaster.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that Saudi Arabia has signed off on the delivery of medical supplies and personnel to Yemen, where the organization had warned that time was running out to save those wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting.

CNN's Devon Sayers, Carma Hassan, Jennifer Deaton, Vasco Cotovio, Jason Hanna, Ben Brumfield, Samira Said and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

-----------------------------------------------
The 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to contest the Masters next week told Sportsmail of his immense relief that he held on to claim the last spot.

Paul Casey was at home in Arizona when the matter was decided last Sunday and admitted he went through all sorts of agonies as his Augusta fate swung back and forth. 

The Englishman got in due to staying in the world’s top 50 but at one point, as events unfolded in Morocco and at the Texas Open, he was projected to fall to 54th.

Paul Casey, pictured in action last month, is the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at the Masters 

‘I was very relieved and now I am just so excited,’ said Casey, who made the last of his eight Masters appearances in 2012. 'On the outside looking in is hardly where you want to be for the season’s first major. I’ve missed the whole experience.’ 

The classy ball striker has got all the tools to do well at Augusta and showed as much when he forced his way into contention on several occasions.

The 37-year-old finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round. He then called a penalty shot on himself at the sixth after his ball moved a fraction when he addressed it with his putter.

It’s a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and Casey said, smiling:’It would be nice to wind the clock back, wouldn’t it? It did affect me for a few holes and I fell away (he finished 10th). But I’m going back a lot wiser and far better equipped if I got in contention again.’

Casey will wrap up his preparation at the Shell Houston Open, the site of his only PGA Tour victory. Also in the field are Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and a quartet of high class Americans in Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson.

Meanwhile, there’s still no word on whether Tiger Woods will play the Masters, although he did at least declare his intent by pitching up for a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday.

The friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway when a conductor on the 6 train called for help .

-----------------------------------------------
Four burly Swedish cops put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty on a Manhattan subway train last night. 

The friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 

'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post.   

'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty

Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. 

The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports.

Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 

'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 

'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him.  

The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' 

As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. 

Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight

The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene

The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. 

One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 

'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info.

'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said.

When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Misérables.

According to the U.S. Department of Education , female teachers who sexually assaulted students often got a pass in the past . Attitudes have now changed and more are being prosecuted . In U.S. schools last year , almost 800 school employees were prosecuted for sexual assault - nearly a third of them women .

A Saturday Night Live skit about a male student having sex with his female high school teacher painted the relationship as every teen boy's dream, but drew a firestorm of criticism on social media.

The reaction to the comedy sketch reflected a growing view among law enforcement and victims' advocacy groups that it is no laughing matter when a woman educator preys on her male students. 

In U.S. schools last year, almost 800 school employees were prosecuted for sexual assault, nearly a third of them women.

The proportion of women facing charges seems to be higher than in years past, when female teachers often got a pass, said Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Education, who tracked the cases. 

This year's numbers are already slightly ahead of last year with 26 cases of female school employees accused of inappropriate relationships with male students in January compared to 19 cases the previous January. 

Female educators who sexually abuse their students are facing tougher prosecution in part because there are more women police officers. 

There is also a greater awareness among prosecutors, judges and the general public that students who are victimized by an authority figure, regardless of gender, experience trauma with life-long consequences. 

'Law enforcement is increasingly feminized, and women are much less prone to the old attitude: "Oh, this is just some kid who got lucky,'" said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center. 

'They recognize the issues involved and they go after women who violate the statutes.' 

A recent Saturday Night Live skit about a male student having sex with his female high school teacher painted the relationship as every teen boy's dream, but drew a firestorm of criticism on social media

The Twitter furor ignited by the April SNL skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his 'hot' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing

Depression, low-self esteem and difficulty maintaining future relationships are among the long-term consequences that male victims face, according to experts. 

Those problems are sometimes compounded by confusion and guilt over whether they are actually victims since their adolescent bodies involuntarily respond to physical contact. 

Child abuse experts agree it appears female teachers are being prosecuted more vigorously than in the past. 

The crackdown is the result of 'two seismic shifts,' said Christopher Anderson, executive director of Male Survivor, the largest U.S. advocacy organization for male sex-crime victims. 

Pennsylvanian math teacher Erica Ann Ginnetti, 35, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for having sex with a 17-year-old student. The male judge said, 'What young man would not jump on that candy?'

'One is a recognition that it does not matter who the perpetrator is or what the circumstances are. A teacher has absolutely no business engaging in sexual contact with a student,' Anderson said. 

'The second is a shift in the culture where boys and their parents are feeling empowered to come forward to say that something has been done.' 

In recent weeks, a Stamford, Connecticut high school English teacher, Danielle Watkins, 32, whose case was prosecuted by a female state's attorney, was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for having sex with an underage male student. 

In Michigan, a female judge sentenced Kathryn Ronk, 30, a Spanish teacher at Bishop Foley High School in Madison Heights, to up to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy, saying 'the law does not recognize a double standard.' 

In New Jersey, a female prosecutor said the most lenient plea deal she would offer Nicole Dufault, 35, a Columbia High School English teacher accused of sexual relationships with six teenage boys, was 15 years in prison. 

There are contrary examples, such as Pennsylvania's Erica Ann Ginnetti, 35, the Lower Moreland High School math teacher who had sex with a 17-year-old student and was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a male judge who said, 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' 

That was after a female prosecutor reportedly said in court that the victim's senior year became a nightmare, his grades plunged and he still struggles with social interactions. 

But the Twitter furor ignited by the April SNL skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his 'hot' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing. 

'Appalled by the #SNL sketch glorifying sexual abuse of a male student by female teacher. Sends the worst message &minimizes real experiences,' tweeted Heather Timmis @hnt108. 

An SNL spokesperson declined to comment. 

There is no central U.S. reporting system for tracking female teachers who prey on male students, according to federal education officials, but Abbott has been charting the crimes from news coverage. 

His research showed that female teachers far more often than male teachers use social media to lure students, creating an electronic 'paper trail' that may aid prosecutions. 

School districts are increasingly moving to ban private social media contact between teachers and students, sometimes in an effort to prevent inappropriate relationships. 

'Social media enables the behavior to start,' Abbott said. 

'There is no way that a teacher is going to walk up to a kid in the hallway and say, "Hey, would you like to see a naked picture of me?" They won't do it. But they will do that on social media. It's like it erases what used to be that barrier.'

Ella Dawson , 22 , a recent graduate of Wesleyan is revealing her genital herpes status in an attempt to destigmatize the STI . One in six Americans have genital herpes and that number is just among people who have been tested . ` When a real person , a woman you know and respect , casually mentions having herpes , it stops being a punchline and starts being someone 's reality , ' Dawson said .
-----------------------------------------------
A recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize STIs.

Ella Dawson, a recent graduate of Wesleyan University who resides in New York City, was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she's been dropping the 'herpes bomb' about six months after she had her first outbreak.

In her essay for Women's Health Mag, Dawson recalls meeting a boy at a party who offered her a sip of his beer.

I have herpes: Ella Dawson has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition

'Don’t worry,' she remembers him saying. 'I don’t have herpes or anything.'

His words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status.

'"That’s funny,’ I said, with as warm a smile as I could manage. ‘Yeah, that’s really funny. Because I have genital herpes.’ His face crumbled. Not because I grossed him out — I could practically see the wheels turning in his brain as he realized he’d made an ignorant joke at someone else’s expense. The guy started apologizing profusely,"' she wrote in her essay.

Dawson said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture, it's a real issue affecting at least one in six Americans.

Dawson said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the STI in a way that made it less of a stigma.

'I had seen in the flesh what a simple "I have herpes" could do when said fearlessly, without shame,' she wrote.

'Because when a real person — a woman you know and respect — casually mentions having herpes, it stops being a punchline and starts being someone's reality.'

Don't strain: Dawson says that people who have herpes should not feel 'dirty or wrong' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect

According to the CDC about 17 per cent of people ages 14-19 have genital herpes caused by HSV2. 

That percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher.

Even having sex with a condom does not protect someone from the highly contagious virus that only needs skin to skin contact to spread, even if there are no sores present.

The Washington Post reports that according to an advocacy group called Project Accept Herpes didn't become a stigma until after the 1970s.

'[Herpes] was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s,' the group says on their web site.

Dr. Peter Anthony Leone, medical director of the North Carolina HIV/STD Prevention and Control Branch told The Washington Post that the stigmatization of the virus was fueled by conservatives after the 'free love era.'

Courage: Ella Dawson has the courage to tell people about  her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide 

'Herpes was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil,' he said.

'But unless you’re in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has never had sex, you’re at risk.'

Leone said that the sex scare campaign was both emotionally traumatizing and also gave false information about the virus.

A study in the Journal of Health Psychology conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with STIs reported feelings like 'less of a person.'

Leone said that safe sex is very important but that herpes is not merely a sexual condition but it primarily a skin condition.

'The way you remove stigma is by bringing something to light,' he said.

'We need a push coming at the federal level to talk about sex in terms of health and move away from the disease model. Sex should be seen as part of being an adult, a healthy thing you can do and just part of your routine healthcare.'

Dawson told the Washington Post that she will continue to blog about the virus and her dealings with it.

She said that ever since her article on herpes was published she has received several emails from people around the world sharing their own story.

Don't sit in the dark: Ellas Dawson says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it

At last, after months of grey skies and miserable weather, the sun is  out. If you are looking to celebrate the wonderfully balmy weather by taking a  dip, there are a few places you could try. 

Lidos, which are seeing a resurgence as more money is ploughed into renovation and redecoration, are a good first port of call. Picking the right one - that isn't too over-crowded or too run down - is crucial.

In response to extra demand, many pools are extending their opening hours in line with the weather or organising late night swimming slots for busy workers.

If you are looking to celebrate this wonderfully balmy weather by taking a dip, there are lots of places to try

For those who are more adventurous; look around, there are acres of countryside watery holes to dip your toe into.

Whether you pick a lido, river, lake, pool or stream - here are ten of the best swimming locations in the country to cover all your watery needs. 

Tinside Lido, Plymouth

As Art Deco style Lidos go – and there are quite a few – this has to be the most lavish. A fountain spews water from the centre, stripes adorn the lanes and the waterfront pool has panoramic views out to sea.

Tinside Lido underwent a £3.3 million restoration in 2003 and has been voted one of Europe's top 10 pools

It was built in 1935 and underwent a £3.3 million restoration in 2003 to restore it to glory. Voted one of the top 10 best outdoor pools in Europe, it’s definitely worth a splash.

Lake Windermere, Cumbria

Llyn y Fan Fach, Brecon Beacons, Wales

This natural lake is thought to be one of the most haunted bodies of water in Wales. 

It lies at the western border of the indomitable Black Mountains and local lore says that at 2pm on the first Sunday of August the ‘Lady of the Lake’ emerges from its depths.

Stories wildly vary, but many claim she is the wronged wife of a violent husband who walked into the lake after he struck her. That aside, it makes a wonderful place for a bracing swim.

Flashing tanned shoulders and pretty decolletage is a red carpet staple . But it 's not always the easiest look to pull off for those with larger chests . Claire Cisotti and her 34G curves have put six strapless dresses to the test .
-----------------------------------------------
Showcasing a pair of toned arms and a pretty decolletage, the strapless dress is a red carpet staple for fine-boned actresses such as Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow. 

But can a woman with 34G curves like mine ever look fab in a strapless dress? 

SECRET SUPPORT

Lace pencil dress, £169, Monsoon.co.uk

Blue caged heels, £39.99, Zara.com

I would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than I am. This one manages the impossible.

The narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs, making me look taller and slimmer, and the bustline is quite high, hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look.

What I really like is the scalloped edge of the dress against the bust and at the hem, which softens the silhouette.

But while looking summery, the lace fabric actually gives quite a lot of secret support, boosted by the Chantelle strapless bra I wear underneath all the dresses. Great for summer weddings. 4/5

ONE FOR TEENS

Prom-style dress, £58.99, Chichiclothing.com

Gold sandals, £34,99, newlook.com

This might look lovely on a teenage girl, but on me — eek! At 48 I’m at least 30 years too old to carry it off.

The material is flimsy and there’s almost no structure, so my bust looks horribly saggy. And the full skirt makes me look as large around the bottom as I am on top — not a good look.

Forget dream prom dress — this is a nightmare. 1/5

FLATTERING AND COMFY

Floral maxi dress, £72, Asos.com

The large, floral pattern that adorns this floaty maxi dress is the key to its flattering effect.

It distracts the eye which instantly slims you. This is a relaxed, 1970s style, so anything too fitted would look out of place. The best thing is how comfortable it feels. You could wear it anywhere — to the beach, to a garden party, or to an evening do. A winner, and at a great price, too. 5/5

SHORT... BUT NOT SWEET

Mini dress, £45, Riverisland.com; Strap-heeled sandals, £39.99, Zara.com

This clings well and gives me a neat waistline. The bandeau-style top is supportive of my bust while slimming it down.

But below the waist it’s a different story. Quite frankly, the skirt is far too short.

I’ve always believed you have to choose between showing off your boobs or your legs: doing both veers far too close to tarty for my liking. I’d have given this dress full marks if it had been ten inches longer. 2/5

OSCAR WORTHY

Double layer maxi dress, £110, Jarlolondon.co.uk

This clever design has a double layer: the lining clings tightly, but the top layer skims over the chest for a classier silhouette.

The overall look is statuesque and Grecian. The vibrant orange shade makes it the perfect choice for a summer party — it would look fab with a tan. In it, I feel like Cameron Diaz going up for an Oscar. I’m ready for my close-up. 5/5

I LOOK SO SLIM

Sweetheart neckline dress, £150, Coast-stores.com; Heels. £485, biondacastana.com

This sophisticated little summery frock has a sweetheart neckline, which curves down to show a bit of cleavage and then rises up to cover the breasts on either side, striking the perfect balance between flirtiness and discretion.

As well as being flattering, the bodice is structured and well-made, minimising my bust and giving plenty of support where it’s needed — there’s no way I’ll be falling out of this frock.

The clingy pencil skirt has the same miraculous effect, slimming down my bottom and hips, and falling flatteringly below the knee.

I can certainly imagine myself going to a summer wedding in this little green number. 4/5

Arsene Wenger is a great admirer of Raheem Sterling , while both he and Theo Walcott are struggling to negotiate new deals . Sterling has scored more goals and provided more assists this season . Walcott is an example of unrealised potential that Sterling must avoid .
-----------------------------------------------
Raheem Sterling and Theo Walcott will likely go head-to-head at the Emirates on Saturday. 

They are at starkly different places in their careers with 26-year-old Walcott perhaps acting as a cautionary tale for Sterling, 20, that early promise can sometimes give way to unfulfilled potential. 

Both are in the process of negotiating contracts with their respective clubs. Brendan Rodgers has spoken in the past of his admiration for Walcott while Wenger has made no secret he is a fan of Sterling. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the clubs could do a direct swap. 

Although Wenger would have to deviate from his usually cautious financial approach to win the race to sign Sterling while Rodgers would be hard pushed to sell Walcott as a worthy replacement for Sterling. 

Here Sportsmail looks at the merits of the two English wingers.

Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling, England's leading wingers, are both in contract negotians with their clubs

Sterling has been one of Liverpool's best players this season, but his contract dispute has caused problems

THIS SEASON SO FAR

Sterling: He has been one of Liverpool’s best players throughout the season, making 28 Premier League appearances and scoring six top-flight goals while boasting an impressive 81% pass completion rate. He has as struggled to make an impact since being used as a wing-back.

Walcott: There’s not a lot to go on for Walcott, who has played just 13 games in all competitions, struggling for game time after returning from a long-term layoff for a knee injury. 

Arsenal do seem to perform slightly better when Walcott features, winning 62.50% of their Premier League games when he is in the team, compared to 59.1% without him.

TEAM PLAYER?

Sterling: While Sterling’s contract negotiations might be viewed as a distraction to the team he has been an unselfish and determined player during his career so far, providing seven assists in the Premier League this season. 

He has linked up well with Daniel Sturridge before the striker was injured and happily played second fiddle to Luis Suarez last season when Brendan Rodgers built his team around the Uruguayan.

Walcott: Is always encouraging to younger players and a good influence to have in the dressing room but he has failed to provide one assist this season and rarely contributes to defensive duties. 

Walcott looked out of sorts for England this week, and has not yet provided an assist this season

Sterling turns away from Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs when the two clubs met earlier this season

WOW FACTOR

Sterling: Sterling is undoubtedly exciting, can provoke disbelief with his mazy runs and deceptive strength for someone so slight. 

But his biggest strength is his pace. His top speed this season of 21.77 mph puts him sixth in the Premier League rankings. 

The problem could lie in the fact he may not be as good as he thinks he is.

Walcott: The off-the-mark pace and an eye for the unconventional yet effective pass which made Walcott a sensation as a 16-year-old playing for Southampton have waned somewhat. 

Although he is still quick, his fastest sprint this season registering at 21.11 mph, a series of injuries have impacted his speed. His inventiveness off-the-ball has been dulled by a lack of confidence. 

If he can have a period of uninterrupted play he might be able to recapture some of his ‘wow factor’ but he is never going to be a world-class player or a game changer.

First team opportunities have been limited for Walcott this season, with the winger frustrated by injury

Sterling has scored six times and created 62 chances in the Premier League this season

 

FANS' FAVOURITE? 

Sterling: Sterling has damaged his public image, possibly irreparably, in the red half of Merseyside with protracted contract wrangling over recent weeks. 

He said in an interview with the BBC’s Natalie Perks that he wanted to dispel the idea he was a greedy 20-year-old. 

But he could have done that simply by signing a £100,000 a week contract at a club where he plays regularly and the manager is proven at developing young talent, if that really was the case.

Walcott: He is a likeable personality, rarely in the headlines for the wrong reasons, but fans will ultimately judge him on his play and Walcott seems to divide opinion. 

He has flashes of brilliance but his form is erratic and fans want someone they can count on.

THE FUTURE

Sterling: It is easy to forget Sterling, who made his full Liverpool debut at 17 years, 107 days, is still only 20. On the face of it his future is blindingly bright and his potential boundless. 

Sterling has hit a top speed of 21.77 mph this season, ranking him sixth in the Premier League.  Walcott's fastest speed this season is 21.11 mph.

Clubs all over Europe are said to be monitoring him and he has admitted it is his dream to play for a big club ‘somewhere warm’ but we have seen all too many times young talent going unrealised. 

The decisions Sterling and his advisors make in the coming months could be crucial.

Walcott: For Walcott, who was selected for his first World Cup at 16, the last six years have been marred by a failure to deliver on his promise. 

Those clubs who might be interested in signing him should take encouragement from the fact we might not have seen the best of Walcott yet. 

Sterling might have permanently damaged his relationship with the Liverpool fans with his interview

The 20-year-old could still stay at Anfield beyond this summer if manager Brendan Rodgers gets his way

Workers aged 18-25 saw wages rise eight times faster than over 50s . In three months , 5.4 % of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs , 1.2 % aged 50-64 . ONS says young have ` willingness to move to higher-paying positions '
-----------------------------------------------
Older workers are suffering dismal pay rises while those awarded to the youngest workers have gone up by nine times as much.

The gap between wage rises for young and older staff has widened significantly during the past five years, amid claims the over-50s are being left behind, official figures reveal.

Critics said employers were cynically taking advantage of older workers who stay with the same company for longer by failing to train and promote them or give them decent annual pay rises.

The under-25s saw their wages rise more than eight times faster than the over-50s, as they quickly climbed the rungs of the career ladder

Last year, workers aged 18 to 24 received bumper 10.6 per cent pay rises, falling to 3.8 per cent for people aged 25 to 34 and to 2 per cent for workers aged 36 to 49. For workers aged 50 to 64, pay rises plunge to a meagre 1.2 per cent, official figures show – significantly below the UK average of 2.1 per cent.

The Office for National Statistics revealed in its latest Economic Review that the under-25s are five times as likely to have moved jobs in the past three months than workers over-50.

But while younger workers often receive greater pay rises because they move jobs more frequently, official data shows that the gap is widening.

In 2009, Britain’s youngest workers received pay rises three times greater than older workers, but this has now widened to nine times greater. 

In the last three months of 2014, 5.4 per cent of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs, compared to only 1.2 per cent of 50-64-year-olds

Experts said the growing gulf between the generations could signal a reluctance by employers to train and promote older members of staff. Ros Altmann, a Whitehall adviser on older workers, said: ‘Younger people’s pay is rising faster than average and the rate of increase is accelerating.

‘It could be because younger people are the most likely to receive training, with employers keen to focus on the newer workers and spending far less on training older workers.

‘With the pace of change in technology and processes being so rapid nowadays, the need for ongoing training is more important than ever, so people do not fall behind in terms of pay and productivity.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, claiming the Tories 'believe in the old idea that as long as the rich and powerful are OK then everyone else will succeed'

She also criticised the Government for subsidising training for under-25s, ‘so that employers find it much cheaper to train youngsters than older workers’.

She added: ‘The increase in pay for younger workers is great news and shows they are progressing well. On the other hand, those who are in their later years seem less likely to be treated so generously and have not been able to enjoy the same kind of pay growth as younger colleagues.’

Lisa Harris, at over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: ‘Many older workers have spent years climbing the career ladder and are more likely to value the job satisfaction and security of doing the job they know well over the pursuit of more money.

‘However, it’s important that employers properly value the contribution and commitment of older workers and ensure they are fairly paid for the job they do and are not taken advantage of.’

Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference.

'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football.

'Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.'

UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down.

Greece's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night: 'We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill. The supervision exercised in Greek football by FIFA and UEFA has failed.'

Northampton were 27-0 down at the break at the Stade Marcel-Michelin . Noa Nakaitaci , Wesley Fofana and Nick Abendanon went over for Clermont . Alex Waller scored a late try for the visitors on Saturday night .
-----------------------------------------------
The Champions of England were smashed into submission at Stade Marcel Michelin on Saturday night, to further expose the vast gulf in clout between the Aviva Premiership clubs and their rich French rivals.

This was a brutal mismatch and a shattering result, not just for the ambitious Saints but for the English game as a whole. Jim Mallinder’s men are imperious in domestic rugby — leading the league by 10 points — but they were simply obliterated by the formidable Top 14 giants.

Clermont are nigh-on invincible at home and Northampton could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena. Even in the brief moments when the Saints had the temerity to work up a head of steam and go through the phases, they were pounded back in the tackle and turned over time and time again.

Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) scores his second try against Northampton

What unfolded was one-way carnage. France wing Noa Nakaitaci scoring two tries before half-time and Nick Abendanon, the ex-Bath and England full-back, capped a masterful display with a break-away try from 90 metres out. All the while, Brock James kept cranking up the points tally with supreme goal-kicking.

Aside from the misery of being dumped out of the Champions Cup in such emphatic fashion, the concern for the Saints will be that this grim rout critically damages their confidence at a key stage of the season. For Northampton and England, there may also be worries over two leading forwards, as Courtney Lawes failed to reappear after half-time and Alex Corbisiero went off, apparently suffering pain in his right knee.

Nick Abendanon of Clermont dives over to score a try at the Stade Marcel-Michelin

It was over as a contest long before half-time. There was a pronounced intensity deficit between the sides from the off, with Northampton losing the collisions and appearing somewhat sluggish in contrast to their fired up and energetic opponents.

The procession began in the fifth minute when the Saints conceded an early scrum penalty. James landed his first shot at goal and the hosts were on their way.

There was so much pressure from Clermont that it was just a matter of time before the Northampton defence was breached. Sure enough, the first try came in the 13th minute, as Fritz Lee blasted clear from a lineout on the right and he released Wesley Fofana.

Abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory

The France centre was tackled in the 22 by Lee Dickson, but the attack continued at a furious tempo and, when Nakaitaci carved inside off his left foot, he was half stopped, but managed to climb up off the turf, stretch and touch down. The try was confirmed by the TMO and converted by James.

It didn’t help the Saints’ already bleak cause that they missed their first scoring chance. After Courtney Lawes had pinched a Clermont lineout throw, the visitors won a penalty but Stephen Myler was off target with the kick.

James landed another penalty, then came the two-try barrage which buried Northampton’s hopes of a famous result. At the heart of the onslaught was Abendanon. First, his break laid the platform for Fofana to burst deep into enemy territory and after Napolioni Nalaga was tackled short of the line, the ball was switched right and James’ lofted pass sent Nakaitaci over for his second try.

Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat

James converted from a wide angle then two minutes before the break, the blitz continued. Jonathan Davies made ground in the centre, Fofana picked out Abendanon and he raced into space, drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home No 12 to charge clear and touch down. Once again, James added the extras and the Saints were sunk.

After the break, James struck another penalty before Abendanon made his long-range dash to the line in the 55th minute, for another converted try. Eventually, with Julien Bonnaire in the sin-bin, Alex Waller crashed over to give Northampton something to show for all their desperate toil, but it was far too little, far too late. The horse had bolted. The game was up.

As many as 1.9 million foreigners travelling on short term visas are predicted to be spending time Down Under at any one time throughout this year

Secretary of the Immigration Department  Michael Pezzullo revealed these figures at a speech at the Australian National University on Tuesday night, Fairfax Media reported.

Mr Pezzullo said the challenges were on par to the high numbers in the aftermath of World War II.

He said there were more east and southern Asians than Europeans moving to Australia in what has been a quick and significant shift as the number of Chinese-born Australians had tripled in the past 20 years.  

'This is equivalent to a migrant-to-population share of almost 28 per cent,' Mr Pezzullo said. 

'And the composition of that population is changing in ways that the proponents of 'White Australia' could never have imagined.'

While a record 185,000 permanent migrants moved to Australia in 1969 - this figure is likely to be exceeded in 2015 as people are moving to the Lucky Country in droves

Mr Pezzullo pointed out that the nation's 'well-crafted and targeted' immigration program towards skilled migrants was a significant factor to the increase of people uprooting to Australia. 

'Migrants enjoy high levels of economic participation as distinct from high levels of social exclusion and welfare-dependency, he said.

'Immigration has beneficial impacts in terms of growth in the demand for goods and services, increases in national income and living standards, improved labour participation, expansion of the economy's productive capacity and growth in household consumption and public revenues,' Mr Pezzullo said.

In an interview with The New York Times , President Obama says he understands Israel feels particularly vulnerable . Obama calls the nuclear deal with Iran a `` once-in-a-lifetime opportunity '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and many U.S. Republicans warn that Iran can not be trusted .
-----------------------------------------------
Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama says he is "absolutely committed to making sure" Israel maintains a military advantage over Iran.

His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran. Tehran agreed to halt the country's nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran's economy.

Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn't "have the luxury of testing these propositions" in the deal.

"But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them," Obama said.

That, he said, should be "sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table," he said.

The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060, limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections. The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30.

But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran won't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country's leadership isn't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are.

Obama said even if Iran can't be trusted, there's still a case to be made for the deal.

"In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they're doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon," Obama said.

A police crime commissioner is facing investigation after awarding more than half a million pounds of taxpayers' money to the charity she runs alongside the force's chief. 

Vera Baird donated £500,000 to Victims First Northumbria, a charity which supports crime victims in her area and of which she is a director.

Vera Baird, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, faces a Ministry of Justice investigation after allocating more than £500,00 of public money to a charity of which she is the director

Sitting alongside Ms Baird on Victims First Northumbria's top table is Chief Constable Sue Sim. The pair are pictured together, above 

It comes after the Home Secretary implemented a rule allowing PCCs to commission services for victims of crime.  

Last month Ms Baird boasted of the securing of funds for the charity in an article on its website. 

'From April 1, I become responsible for some victims’ services after funding was devolved by the Ministry of Justice to PCCs,' she wrote. 

A Northumbria Police spokesman said the funds would be allocated 'in the same manner that Victim Support were directly funded by the MOJ'.  

But critics have described her selection of charity as 'inappropriate' and a conflict of interest. 

Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs committee, said: 'Northumbria police appears to have developed its own soap opera. 

'It is totally inappropriate for a PCC to set up any organisation in which they have an interest of whatever kind using public money.' 

In an article on the charity's website, Ms Baird boasted of securing the funds from the public purse last month

Mrs Sim shot to prominence within the force over her handling of the hunt for Raoul Moat in 2010. She is pictured above with Deputy Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson at a press conference following his death 

Adding the fact that Chief Constable Sue Sim was 'wrong', Mr Vaz said commissioners should never have been given the ability to allocate public funds to charity.   

'The Home Secretary should never have given these powers.'

Ms Baird stood by her decision today, telling MailOnline: 'All Ministry of Justice procedures and protocols were adhered to.

Keith Vaz accused the force of creating its own 'soap opera' 

'I am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create Victims First Northumbria were the right ones.'

Mrs Sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in June. 

She was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by Ms Baird, her co-director at Victims First Northumbria. 

A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken. 

'The MoJ requires PCCs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established.'

Victims First Northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor, Victim Support, plummeted. 

But sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by Mrs Sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week. 

The police chief who shot to prominence after her handling of the Raoul Moat manhunt in 2010, said she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. 

Ms Baird praised her 'passion and enthusiasm', adding: 'Sue and I have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since I became police and crime commissioner.'

New Royal Caribbean cruise ship Anthem of the Seas is sailing out of Southampton this summer . It has innovations including robot bartenders who dance to music as well as pour margaritas . The liner holds the title of being the world 's third largest cruise ship , with room for nearly 5,000 passengers .
-----------------------------------------------
Some of us don't like to hit the bar before midday, but when your drink is poured by a robot bartender you make an exception - even when mine jerks suddenly and I fear a malfunction. 

But, hang on a minute, it's simply giving my margarita a good shake. 

Pouring drinks is only one of these bartenders' tricks. In the evening, they dance to music.

New attraction: The enormous Anthem Of The Seas is set to welcome more than 80,000 people on board this summer

Making waves: An instructor demonstrates the FlowRider wave machine on board Royal Caribbean's ship, Anthem Of The Seas

The Bionic Bar is among many hi-tech gimmicks on board the 4,180-passenger Anthem Of The Seas, Royal Caribbean's second Quantum-class liner, which last week set sail on its maiden voyage. 

Passengers have rubber wristbands fitted with electronic chips, which can be pressed against various sensors. 

I use mine as a room key, to make payments and to check my itinerary on handy tablets around the ship.

The 375 interior staterooms also have sea views from virtual balconies — window-sized LED screens showing real-time footage shot by exterior cameras. 

This ship is clearly aimed at younger cruisers. 

The indoor SeaPlex activity area (the largest of its kind at sea) has bumper cars, a roller disco and circus school. 

There's also an observation capsule (another first), which swoops out over the ship, a FlowRider wave machine for surfing and body­ boarding, and RipCord by iFLY - a vertical wind tunnel for skydiving at sea.

I'll have a caipirinha, please: Robotic bartenders mix and serve cocktails in the decidedly futuristic Bionic Bar

Fairground thrills: Adrenaline junkies will also be able to enjoy the bumper cars as part of an amazing variety of entertainment

Take a seat: The Music Hall on the Anthem of the Seas is just one of the entertainment venues on this colossal vessel

At the latter, my instructor tells me to thrust out my hips to avoid spinning out of control. 

In my post-­skydive photo, the instructor has two arms around my bottom and his face in my chest - and I look as though I've had a bad facelift. 

The Anthem's 18 restaurants include a hotdog-­filled food truck and a Johnny Rockets American diner.

For now, Anthem Of The Seas will remain on this side of the pond, exploring Western Europe from her home port of Southampton. 

In October, she will cross the Atlantic before spending the winter cruising the Caribbean.

Which gives the robotic bartender plenty of time to perfect his margarita­ mixing skills.

Seven nights on Anthem Of The Seas (www.royalcaribbean.co.uk, 0844 493 2061), departing Southampton on June 13, costs from £979pp. 

It will sail to Gijon and Bilbao in Spain, Guernsey's St Peter Port, and Le Havre in France before returning to Southampton.

Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro came back from a dreadful first set to defeat three-times Miami Open champion Venus Williams 0-6, 6-1, 7-5 at Key Biscayne on Tuesday and set up a semi-final clash with Germany's ninth seed Andrea Petkovic.

Petkovic booked her place in the last four after a 6-4, 6-2 win over 14th seeded Czech Karolina Pliskova.

Williams utterly dominated the first set, crushing the Spaniard 6-0 in less than half an hour but her opponent was able to regroup and battle back in impressive style.

Suddenly regaining her confidence Suarez Navarro won the first four games and went on to take the second set 6-1.

The third set bucked the trend for one-sided exchanges until Suarez Navarro broke to go 5-4 up only for Venus to break back straight away.

The Spaniard won the last two games however to continue an impressive season that has seen her reach two other semi-finals and make the last eight at Indian Wells for the first time.

'It was a crazy match, crazy first two sets. Venus was unbelievable at the beginning. I started a bit nervous but even if you lose the first set you are still in the competition and I am happy with the way I came back,' said Suarez Navarro.

Williams said she had struggled to find consistency.

'I just made a little too many errors and I was going for it the whole match. Towards the end just never found the happy medium between being aggressive and putting the ball in the court,' she said.

Petkovic made a blistering start, going up 4-1 in the first set but the 23-year-old Pliskova powered her way back to 4-4 and then had three break points, all of which were saved.

Petkovic, the 2011 Miami semi-finalist, won the next five games and wrapped up the match in one hour, 16 minutes.

'I was playing really well at the start but I couldn't see the ball on my serve with the sun on one side and I was struggling,' said Petkovic.

'Karolina also started playing really well and I was a little lucky at the end of the first set. But then I got better and better from there,' she said.

Wednesday's quarter-finals see top seed Serena Williams take on Germany's Sabine Lisicki while third-seed Romanian Simona Halep faces American Sloane Stephens.

Italian photographer Giovanna Griffo , 42 , shares her talents with images of the Northern Lights and other locations . The teacher of photography and post-production teaches courses all over Italy and recently visited Iceland . She reveals some tips on the best way to capture the Northern Lights and night skies in all their glory .
-----------------------------------------------
A flickering rainbow of colours came with the March solar storm that made the Northern Lights even more remarkable than usual, and Italian photographer Giovanna Griffo was in Iceland to capture them in all their glory. 

Griffo, 42, who is based in Latina, led a group of her students to Vik and Hella in the south of Iceland where they were fortunate enough to be blown away by what is said to have been the strongest geomagnetic storm in the current  solar cycle.

While Giovanna takes and edits all manner of photographs, she has a particular affinity with the night sky - and not just the spectacular Aurora Borealis but locations in her own country too.

In March, the Northern Lights were even more remarkable than usual and Griffo was in Iceland to capture them in all their glory

This images of the night sky being illuminated with stunning yellow and pink was taken from a road outside Vik in Iceland's south

'These shots have been taken in different locations in Italy and Iceland,' Griffo tells MailOnline. 'You can find amazing nightscapes almost everywhere, I started collecting night scenes near my home town and went always further and further trying to capture iconic places all around the world. 

'The Northern Lights were one of my dreams, so I went some weeks ago to Iceland hoping to be lucky enough to get one!

'I have to say I have been so much more than just lucky, since I got one the most powerful solar storm in the last three years that made an incredibly Aurora visible in Germany too!'

Griffo, the daughter of two artists, teaches photography and post-production in seminars all around Italy and is also the editor and founder of the photo community www.maxartis.i.

A keen photographer since she was six spending time in her father's dark room, she still considers developing films and printing a form of 'magic' to this day.  

But you are in control of some elements of the craft and there are ways to maximise your chances to capture something as wonderful as these examples, and a lot of it comes down to the location.  

'Scouting places in your own country is definitely simpler than when you are abroad,' she says. 'In any case it is important to scout them during day time. It is extremely difficult discover a good place during night time, so usually I come back just before darkness in order to be able to frame the picture and studying the right composition.'

 A keen photographer since she was six spending time in her father's dark room, she still considers photography a form of 'magic' 

And patience is a virtue that cannot be underestimated.  

'Night photography is always tricky and full of issues to overcome! It is difficult managing your gear in complete darkness and often you are in very lonely places where it is not so safe to stay. You can find dangerous wildlife or even people with bad intentions. You have to pay a lot of attention and be prepared to stay many hours at very low temperatures.'

'You need to scout a location with clear sky during a night rather with no moon. Try to use a fast lenses (f/2.8 is better), a shutter speed between 8 and 15 sec (it depends how fast the aurora moves) and ISO between 1600 and 2500.'

Prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has only been on the job since January . She comes from a long line of police officers . `` I think that she will follow where the evidence leads . I do not think she will follow just public opinion , '' says a supporter .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Shortly after being elected chief prosecutor, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said prosecutors in the hardscrabble town had the "toughest job in America."

Mosby, who took over her first elected post in January, now faces what is likely to be the toughest case of her nascent career -- deciding whether criminal charges should be filed against Baltimore police officers in the controversial death of Freddie Gray.

Gray, 25, died in police custody from a fatal spinal cord injury, one week after he was arrested. Six officers involved in his arrest have been suspended with pay pending an investigation.

Mosby, 35, who comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother, assumes a key role in the latest case to draw national attention to the issue of relations between police officers and the communities they are sworn to serve.

"My grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in Massachusetts and one of the things he instilled on us is the importance of public service," Mosby said in a campaign video.

Freddie Gray's mysterious death has turned the largely black city near the nation's capital into a tinderbox where mostly peaceful demonstrations on Monday erupted in pockets of looting and rioting in the hours after Gray's funeral.

A 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect two days ago, and National Guard troops have joined Baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order.

On Thursday, as police handed their investigative files over to the state attorney's officer a day earlier than planned, supporters of the former insurance company lawyer expressed confidence in Mosby's ability to handle the volatile case.

"We're enthusiastic about the new prosecutor," said William "Billy" Murphy Jr., a former Baltimore judge who is now the lead attorney for Gray's family. "She comes to the office with a belief in the integrity of these kinds of investigations. We have much more confidence in her than we have in the police because there's never been any level of confidence, nor should there be, in the police investigating themselves."

Mosby confirmed in a statement Thursday that she had received the police's investigative report. She said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings, her team has been conducting its own independent probe into the April 19 death.

"While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings, but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified," Mosby said. "We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system."

Mosby is married to Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby, who represents areas of West Baltimore where riots erupted earlier this week. The couple have two young daughters.

"She's my wife," Nick Mosby told CNN on Thursday. "She's a strong woman. She was built for this ...  I was at church service the other day and they were talking about being at the right place with the right person at the right time. I know her heart has always been convicted to ensure that justice will be served fairly and equally across the board."

During her campaign, Mosby spoke about the broad daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep.

"I learned very early on that the criminal justice system isn't just the police, the judges and the state's attorney," she said. "It's much more than that. I believe that we are the justice system. We, the members of the community, are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes."

Mosby said her cousin's 1994 murder was her first introduction to the criminal justice system.

"Having to go to court and deal with prosecutors," she said. "Having to go to court and see my neighbor who had the courage and audacity to cooperate with the police ... to testify in court and the way the district attorney's office treated my family is something that inspired me."

Mosby, who grew up in Boston, is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in the United States, according to the state's attorney's website.

At the age of 6, Mosby was accepted in a school desegregation program in Massachusetts. She later participated in a study of the civil rights movement.

"After having that awesome experience I knew I wanted to be an attorney," she said during her campaign.

A. Dwight Pettit, a civil rights attorney and Mosby supporter, said he believes she will "deliver on doing it right, and getting it right. I'm confident in that."

"She's very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office, and so I believe that she will move in a methodical way," he said. "And I think that she will follow where the evidence leads. I do not think she will follow just public opinion."

When she was sworn in as chief prosecutor earlier this year, Mosby brought up the lack of trust between the community and police.

"Our time to repair that trust, to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now," she said.

Mosby added, "As a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color, I will seek justice on your behalf."

Mosby is African-American, as are Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts and other leading Baltimore officials. Although about 63% of Baltimore's population is black, they face stunning disparities when it comes to income, employment, poverty, housing, incarceration and overall health.

The people on Mosby's transition team included former Mayor Kurt Schmoke, former congressman and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume and Murphy, who is now representing Gray's family.

Schmoke, a former state's attorney and Baltimore's first African-American mayor, said Mosby's background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice.

"I actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, was recently elected," he said. "She has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience. I can't say how long, but I do think that people will give her a little bit more time to do it right rather than to do it fast."

Mosby defeated Gregg Bernstein as state's attorney in a 2014 election.

"Baltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court -- we've got the toughest job in America," she said in a statement after the election.

Mary Koch, another attorney for Gray's family, said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her.

"The family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that's not going to be an easy job for Ms. Mosby," said Koch, adding: "That's her job. That's the job she took on."

A Pennsylvania couple have been killed after their 1923 Model T Ford convertible skidded off the roadway and flipped over.

Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred.

First responders arrived to find that the couple had died from multiple traumatic injuries suffered in the crash.

Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch.

It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. 

Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn.

The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 

'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer.

The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Now share your opinion

The PacMan is the happiest soul in Las Vegas, smiling, cracking jokes, bidding everyone welcome.

His latest toy is a camera which he points at whoever he comes across, saying: ‘I don’t know much about these things but I like taking portraits.'

There is no hint of strain even as the conversation turns to the Fight of the Century.

‘OK, this is the most important fight for my boxing legacy but I know I am going to win,' he says.

‘We have several strategies for this fight. I’m very comfortable.

‘I can’t say Mayweather is the most dangerous opponent of my career because I haven’t fought him yet.

‘At the moment it’s Oscar De La Hoya, Miguel Cotto and Juan Manuel Marquez.

‘I can say he’s a difficult opponent but I’m comfortable and confident. My killer instinct is back.

‘I’m different from the 47 opponents he’s fought before. I’m faster than any of them. He will experience his first loss.

‘This is the right time for me to fight Floyd. I’m more experienced now than five years ago. The speed and power are still there. No age changes in me.'

They have been accused of delaying this epic for five years too long but Pacquiao adds: ‘Now even people who don’t follow boxing want to watch this fight.

A few hours after Pacquiao arrived, Floyd Mayweather met fans at the MGM Grand.

He has no qualms about being cheated by the judges, the way he was in his first fight with Tim Bradley here, even though Las Vegas enjoys huge economic impact from Mayweather’s fights and two of the officials are Nevada residents.

‘I always trust the judges and the commission,’ he says. 'I will throw a lot of punches and I believe I can win every round.’

His master trainer Freddie Roach is equally confident: ‘We’ve wanted this fight every day of our lives together. Now its bigger than ever.

‘Manny’s ready. We’ve got a great strategy. We’ve worked on it together and we’re much closer now.

‘He’s been showing me things, which I like. There’s been a lot excitement in the gym with the work he’s being doing.

‘His level came up the day the fight was announced. He’s never worked so hard.’

Pacquiao had set fight week rolling by playing host to hundreds of his supporters at a meet, greet and sing-along fan fest.

He took over a huge convention centre at the Mandalay Bay hotel, where he is staying in a penthouse suite with a view across the fabled Strip to the MGM Grand where he and Mayweather will finally settle their pound-for-pound differences in Saturday night’s Fight of the Century

Fans had waited patiently for a glimpse of the Filipino superstar on Tuesday afternoon

Then came the Philippines national anthem, to a backdrop of pictures of the mud-hut village In which he was born and grew up.

And, of course, much high-pitched squealing and screaming when the great man himself took to the stage, albeit that he took a small leaf out of Mayweather’s book by making his entrance 45 minutes late.

‘Manny’s in the building,’ the announcers kept shouting as we waited for what they seemed to regard as The Second Coming.

This was the scene-stealer by Pacquiao and his promoter Bob Arum after declining to take part in the traditional Grand Arrival of the fighters at the MGM Grand, in which Mayweather would be starring later in the day.

The rift had been ignited by the dispute over the allocation of tickets for Saturday night between the two camps, which had delayed their sale and momentarily jeopardised the fight.

Both men insist that the bad blood will not spill over into the fight, which they will approach with professional intensity.

An incredible array of merchandise has been produced for the fight this weekend

There was folk music and dancing, there were Philippine tunes belted out by artists from Pacquiao’s homeland.

There was screening of the PacMan singing the specially written song he has recorded as the music for his ring entrance. 

Pacquiao said: ‘It’s not personal for us. It’s personal for the fans.’

Giant screens in the convention centre showed highlights of some of Pacquiao’s more spectacular victories, to much enthusiasm from the faithful.

There is a substantial Filipino community in this region of America - 7,000 in southern Nevada alone - and Pacquiao may well have the greater support in the Grand Garden Arena.

The travelling British fight fraternity - the advance guard arrived in time to join the Fan Fest and the Grand Arrival – are split between Money and Manny.

Arum effected the introduction of ‘the man you love and who will be victorious on Saturday night.’

Pacquiao shook a hundred hands before he said: ‘Don’t get nervous on Saturday. I’m the one who’s going to win the fight. So relax. It is time for Mayweather to lose.

‘Just be excited. I’m excited. Thank you for your overwhelming support and prayers. I love you guys. God bless.’

The noise was deafening.

And there are still four days to go.

Ben Wedeman joins the Calabrese , an Italian patrol boat as it traverses the Mediterranean looking for migrants . Often the crew have little to report , only coming across fishing boats or other commercial vessels . The Calabrese was involved in a rescue in October 2013 , during which more than 350 people died .
-----------------------------------------------
Lampedusa, Italy  (CNN)The cramped galley of the ship is filled with the smell of fresh garlic frying in olive oil. Gaetano Cortese, a tall, thin, sunburned 27-year veteran of Italy's Guardia di Finanza (Finance Police) is waxing eloquent on his favorite subject: food.

"We picked it this morning from the hills of Lampedusa," he declares with a flourish, waving thin sprigs of wild asparagus under my nose. He demonstrates how you must break it apart with your fingers, bit by bit, until you get to the hard part, which you keep aside to boil down in water for the pasta sauce he is preparing with his shipmate, Enzo Idone.

Cooking, however, may be a positive distraction from dark memories.

How I was smuggled into Europe -- and why it was worth it

We boarded the Finance Police's ship, the Calabrese, in Lampedusa harbor earlier in the evening. The Calabrese regularly patrols the Mediterranean off Lampedusa, which is Italy's southernmost territory and just 70 miles, or just over 110 kilometers, from the Tunisian coast. In recent years, it has been the first point of entry to Europe for tens of thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East.

A few years ago, the Calabrese was on the look out for "contrabandisti," smugglers trafficking in cigarettes and drugs. But in recent years, its 12-man crew has joined Italy's effort to rescue migrants coming from Africa and the Middle East.

We spend seven hours on board the ship, but nothing much happens. We see some Italian fishing boats the crew knew by sight. Shortly after sunset, the Calabrese's captain, Gianluca Busonera, begins calling out quick orders to his men as we approach a small boat.

The easy-going crew seem to tense up. One man turns on a bright spotlight and focuses the beam on the boat, while another with powerful binoculars read out the name on the back.

Busonera peers intently at the boat, which appears to be a fishing vessel, then shrugs. "It's fine," he tells me. "If it were low in the water, we'd know it was full of people, but this boat is riding high."

He waves to the Tunisian boat, where an older man in a jacket waves back. Busonera gives him a thumbs up, and steers the ship to the right.

It's a routine evening for the Calabrese, and that is just fine with the crew. They've seen enough troubles in their time to appreciate an uneventful day's work.

Back in the galley, I ask Cortese about his worst experience while serving at sea with the Guardia di Finanza. He and most of his shipmates took part in the rescue effort on October 3, 2013, after a ship with hundreds of migrants had gone down off Lampedusa. More than 350 people died in that disaster. The crew of the Calabrese was able to rescue four of the survivors.

Cortese's cheery demeanor suddenly becomes serious. "I still remember pulling out of the water, with our hands, a young, pregnant woman who had just died," he recalls.

"There were children," adds his crewmate, Idone, shaking his head. "We recovered the bodies of children. It was a bad situation. I remember the body of a boy we recovered. We put him in a body bag. His head was in this hand," he said waving his hand as if he had just picked up the lifeless body.

Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy

Cortese and Idone stress that as fathers, there is nothing worse than having to see the bodies of dead children.

"At the moment," recalls Cortese, "we were too busy to think about it, but when we go home, before going to sleep, it comes back to us." He emphasizes that he and his shipmates were just doing their duty as professional military men.

Out in the Mediterranean, with no land in sight, you realize just how vast it is. And although it's been warm on land in Sicily recently, at night on the water, it's cold and windy. On board the Calabrese, we are warm, well-fed and in good company. The ship is well-maintained and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, allowing Busonera to plow confidently through the waves in the dark without fear of running into anything.

It contrasts starkly with conditions migrants have recounted to us of the rickety boats and unseaworthy rubber dinghies they use to try to cross the Mediterranean. Often they're without food, water or shelter, their boat's crew inexperienced and untrained. That's if they have a crew at all. Many migrants have been beaten and robbed of all their possessions before they board.

And unless a ship like the Calabrese comes to their rescue, death at sea is a definite possibility.

'People have asked me how Kevin is doing, how he has been developing superbly and putting in good performances. That is only normal in situations like this. There have not been any concrete offers, though.

German champions Bayern, along with City and Manchester United are known to have watched De Bruyne but De Koster is keen to speak to Wolfsburg and show them the respect he feels they deserve. 

The Belgian is one of the hottest prospects in European football after starring for his side this season

'I can assure you there have not been any talks with Bayern Munich. When you want to know whether Bayern are interested in signing Kevin, you should ask [sporting director] Matthias Sammer or [technical director] Michael Reschke. It is true that I have worked with Reschke before, but that does not mean anything now. 

'We will sit down with Wolfsburg first, that is a matter of respect. They supported Kevin during a difficult period, when he was unhappy at Chelsea.'

Since leaving Chelsea, De Bruyne has established himself as one of the best playmakers in the Bundesliga

Thomas will be a line judge for the 2015 season . The 41-year-old was in the league 's officiating development program in 2013-14 . She was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game . Thomas , a former college basketball player , was inspired to become an official in the 1990s when she attended a meeting with her brother .
-----------------------------------------------
The NFL has its first full-time female game official.

Sarah Thomas, who has worked exhibition games, will be a line judge for the 2015 season, the league announced on Wednesday. The 41-year-old was in the league's officiating development program in 2013-14 and worked some team minicamps last year.

She's already broken ground in the officiating field as the first woman to work college games in 2007. She was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game, the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit.

Sarah Thomas is the NFL's first full-time female referee and will be a line judge during the upcoming season

Thomas poses during the pre-season game between the Seahawks and the Chargers last year

'I am a female, but I don't look at myself as just a female,' Thomas said last June while working a Cleveland Browns minicamp. 'I look at myself as an official.'

Shannon Eastin worked regular-season NFL games in 2012 as a replacement official, making her the first female to do so in any capacity. She also was a line judge.

Thomas, a former college basketball player, was inspired to become an official in the 1990s when she attended a meeting with her brother, Lea. In 1996, Thomas became the first female to officiate in a Division 1-A high school football game in Mississippi.

Just under a decade later, she began officiating college games when she was hired by Conference USA, working as a line judge and head linesman. She also has worked the Senior Bowl, the Fight Hunger Bowl, the Medal of Honor Bowl, and the Conference USA Championship game in 2010 and 2014.

Thomas officiated two seasons in the United Football League, which is now out of business.

Off the field, she's a pharmaceutical representative. She said last June her two sons and one daughter see nothing extraordinary about her football job.

'They just know mom officiates and it's nothing foreign to them or pioneering or anything,' she said. 'I do this.'

Ronald Butcher , 75 , left his entire life savings to builder Daniel Sharp . He cut out his cousin and two family friends who were expecting to inherit . But they are now challenging the will in the High Court saying the pensioner did not know what he was doing .
-----------------------------------------------
A lonely pensioner left half a million pounds to a builder who once agreed to clean out his gutters for free - but the bequest is now at the centre of a High Court legal battle.

Ronald Butcher, a 'private and quiet man', bequeathed his entire £500,000 fortune to Daniel Sharp after he died in March 2013.

But his relatives and family friends insist that the will, made just two months before his death, is invalid and say that the builder is lying about his friendship with Mr Butcher.

Bequest: Ronald Butcher, pictured, left his £500,000 fortune to a builder when he died in 2013

Lucky: Daniel Sharp was given £500,000 by Mr Butcher after doing building work for him free

After the pensioner died at home in Enfield, north London aged 75, his body was not discovered for almost two months, the High Court heard.

Judge Leslie Anderson QC was told that Mr Butcher's 'family' consisted his elderly cousin, Joyce Gilkerson, plus Evelyn Hutchins and Peter Rogers, the children of a close school friend, who regarded him as their 'uncle Ron'.

The three were the equal beneficiaries of a will drawn up by Mr Butcher in December 2011, but after his death they discovered that they had been disinherited.

Araba Taylor, for Mrs Hutchins, told the court that the 'odd' nature of Mr Butcher's bequest to Mr Sharp should 'excite suspicion' that he did not fully understand what he was doing.

But Jennifer Seaman, for Mr Sharp, said: 'Mr Butcher was a lonely man who found a friend in Mr Sharp. Mr Butcher knew what he was doing when he made the 2013 will and what its effect would be.

'He found a male friend in Mr Sharp, somebody he could chat to. They had a shared interest in DIY and he liked to hear about Mr Sharp's son. That is an explanation why he wanted to make the 2013 will.'

Cut out: Evelyn Hutchins, left, and Peter Rogers, right, expected to inherit the bulk of Mr Butcher's fortune

Home: Mr Butcher became friends with Mr Sharp after the builder cleared the gutters of his home in Enfield, pictured, six years before his death

Close: Mr Butcher, left, pictured with members of Mr Rogers and Mrs Hutchins' family

Giving evidence, Mr Sharp described the start of his friendship with Mr Butcher six years before his death, saying: 'When I first cleaned out his gutter he offered me a tenner or twenty quid for it, but I said no, I wouldn't take it. It was a nothing job that took seconds.'

Talking of his feelings on learning of his surprise inheritance, he added: 'At the time I was shocked to be given something like that. It's life changing. Nobody gives you nothing in life.

'I didn't think he had people to give it to, or obviously they had had an argument. Something happened and he gave it to me. I can't say the reason why he gave it to me.

'But if I'm the only one who went round to talk to him... I didn't know what's gone on with the others. Obviously there's been a big falling out.'

Asked why he did not attend Mr Butcher's funeral, Mr Sharp said it would 'just cause arguments' with the pensioner's family, and refuted Miss Taylor's clim that the two men were not in fact friends.

Friendship: Mr Sharp said he did not attend Mr Butcher's funeral because he did not want to upset anyone

Battle: The two sides are locked in a High Court fight at the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured

He said: 'I class a friend as somebody who talks to people. His friends and family hadn't spoken to him in months. At least I was going round whenever I was in the area.

'I'm still shocked today and I can understand why his family are upset about it. But, at the end of the day, there's a reason why he's given it to me. They know it, but I don't.

'We were not good friends, just friends. I never said I was his best mate or whatever.'

Mrs Hutchins, 53, told the court that her family had been close to her honorary 'uncle' Mr Butcher.

She admitted that she and her brother saw less of him after their mother's death, but denied the suggestion that they had 'slowly lost contact' with him.

She said: 'One or other of us would go and see him every break we had. I had tried to pop in around March and had phoned but there was nothing. We were planning to go on a cruise the next year.

'I've never seen Mr Sharp. I would have expected uncle Ron to talk about him.'

Mr Rogers, 57, claimed Mr Sharp was 'lying' about being friends with Mr Butcher, adding: 'My uncle had lots of friends and still came to family parties.

'He and Mr Sharp had nothing in common. It just doesn't add up. He would tell us about what was going on in his life and Mr Sharp never ever came up.'

The hearing continues.

-----------------------------------------------
Australia's biggest venomous snake has produced a huge lethal 'shot' for reptile wranglers on the NSW Central Coast.

In an enormous yield, four-metre long king cobra Raja has delivered almost 500 milligrams of deadly toxin for veteran handler Billy Collett at Gosford's Australian Reptile Park, north of Sydney.

The toxin is enough to fill a shot glass and 40 times the amount of venom of a brown snake.

'It can kill a full grown elephant,' Mr Collett said of the eight kilogram cobra.

Mr Collett has been milking snakes for almost 10 years but has never extracted venom from a king cobra

'It's a very dangerous yield, and they only give you about a third of what they've got,' Mr Collett added.

'They've been known to hold on for minutes when they bite the first time.' 

Its venom will be distributed between research institutes across the country. 

Mr Collett has been milking snakes for almost 10 years but has never extracted venom from a king cobra.

'I was very excited but I was very nervous,' he said after the rare extraction on Thursday.

'He's about as thick as my legs.'

The milking meant Mr Collett could safely measure and weigh the snake, who was last assessed four years ago.

Ruslan Bazarov was on a 100 km cycle ride when he was struck by the truck . The truck passed Barazov on the inside sucking him towards the trailer . The 28-year-old cyclist suffered two fractures to his leg and a pelvic injury . The driver stopped soon after the incident road and blamed Bazarov .
-----------------------------------------------
These are the shocking scenes as a cyclist in Russia narrowly escapes death when a HGV knocks him from his bicycle following a reckless overtaking manoeuvre on a motorway.

The cyclist is pedaling in front of his friend past a junction when the truck comes speeding along the inside, clipping the rider and throwing him clear of his bike. 

The second cyclist does not have any time to react to his friend's accident and is knocked to the ground after careering into the stricken bicycle.

This is the moment a Russian truck flies past a cyclist, pictured, on the outskirts of St Petersberg 

The truck continued along the road for 100 metres before it was stopped by the driver on the hard shoulder

Marathon rider Ruslan Bazarov, 28, suffered pelvic injuries and a broken leg when the truck overtook him on the St Petersburg ring road. 

Bazarov was taking part in the first 100 kilometre ride of the season of the Baltic Star club when the incident happened. 

Moments before the accident, Bazarov made a hand signal to indicate that he was moving into the right hand lane, but the truck, which was carrying flour, sounded its horn and flashed by. 

Bazarov was sucked in towards the truck's trailer and knocked to the ground. 

The riders had planned to ride from Poklonnaya Hill, across the Vyborg, Primorsk and Zelenogorsk highways with the planned finish at Savushkina street in the city.

The truck driver braked heavily as Bazorov tumbled along the tarmac where he suffered fractrues

Bazorov suffered two fractures to his legs and a pelvic area after the collision in St Petersberg

The cyclist cried out in pain due to the serious nature of his injuries suffered during the collision. 

Luckily Bazorov bounced clear of the truck's massive wheels although his bike was badly bent. 

The video, which has since gone viral on the internet has prompted members of Russia's cycling community to demand the creation of safe areas to ride. 

Bazorov suffered a double fracture to his leg as a result of his accident. 

The truck's driver pulled over to the side of the road after 100 metres and blamed Bazarov for causing the incident. 

The driver can be heard on the video remarking: 'Don't complain, it's your own fault. I was driving normally, bro!' 

Fellow rider Paul Gavrilov, 35, said: 'This accident should have been avoided because he could have been killed. If there were better cycle ways and proper access to the ones that exist it would make it safer.'

The son of the Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's richest men, has wed bride Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah in a spectacular ceremony at the monarch's 1,788-room palace in Brunei's capital, Bandar Seri Begawan.

Prince Abdul Malik, 31, exchanged vows with Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah, 22, in front of crowds of friends and family, nobility and foreign dignitaries amid mind-boggling splendour.

The newlyweds' matching gold outfits were both embellished with diamonds, while blushing bride Raabi'atul carried a bouquet made of dazzling gems, rather than flowers.

The enthronement ceremony of Prince Abdul Malik, 31, and Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah, 22, took place in the lavish settings of 1,788-room palace, Istana Nural Iman in Brunei

The happy couple: The bride clutches a bouquet of crystal flowers, and sports a breathtaking three-piece jewellery set, with sizable emeralds

The Prince is the youngest child of the Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, and his wife, Queen Saleha, and is second in the line of succession to become the next Sultan of Brunei. 

Today's 'bersanding' or enthronement ceremony is usually the highlight of the wedding festivities, and saw the bride and groom seated next to each other, dressed in opulent traditional attire on gilded thrones in the Throne Chamber of the Istana Nural Iman palace.  

According to The Brunei Times, also in attendance were seven Malaysian state rulers and the governor of Saudi Arabia, and this is the first time that the couple have appeared together since the festivities started on 5 April. 

The couple wore matching traditional Malay dress, with the bride's veil constructed of swathes of intricate lace.

The 22-year-old bride, who worked as a systems data analyst and IT instructor, sported a breathtaking diamond tiara studded with six teardrop-shaped emeralds.

A diamond necklace with a central pendant of three emeralds the size of grapes, glittered around her neck, while a matching brooch of two egg-shaped emeralds dangled from a diamond setting.

The bride's Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah, 22, has her veil adjusted as she shows off her diamond and emerald tiara, necklace, brooch, bracelet and ring - as well as the delicate posy made of gems

Shoes fit for a princess: The bride wore jewel-encrusted Christian Louboutin heels, as well as a chunky pure gold anklet

The Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, was seen in traditional dress at the wedding ceremony of his son

Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah also toted Christian Louboutin heels encrusted Swarovski crystals, with the distinctive red sole, as well as a chunky gold anklet.

The newlyweds sat side by side praying during a section of the ceremony, and at one point, the Sultan was seen caressing the arms of his son's hand while the blessing of his new wife occurred.

The Sultan has 12 children - five sons and seven daughters - from three different marriages. Prince Abdul Malik is the sixth child of the Sultan and his current wife, Queen Saleha, who wed in 1965.

Part of the ceremony also saw royal guards entering the hall carrying ceremonial shields and spears. 

After the ceremony, there is expected to be a luxurious banquet in the palace's hall, which can accommodate up to 5,000 guests.

The wedding is taking place over a period of 11 days, and started on Sunday, 5 April, with the royal marriage proposal ceremony.

During this time, a representative of the groom approached the bride's family with the groom's intention of seeking the bride's hand in marriage.

This signalled the beginning of the ceremonial events, and has been followed by a 'powdering' ceremony - when members of the families from both sides anoint the couple with powder and scented oil on the palms of their hand - and a gifting ceremony.

Royal guards stood in large numbers in the Throne Hall, carrying ceremonial shields and spears

In attendance were also Ragad Kurdi Taib, wife of Sarawak's former Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud (pictured left), and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsen bin Abdul Aziz (pictured right)

Friends and family, people of nobility and international dignitaries attended the ceremony, as the couple sat beneath in their gilded thrones

The Sultan of Brunei was seen caressing his son's hand while the blessing of the bride took place

The celebration will end on 15 April, with a ceremony of thanksgiving prayers.  

The location of the wedding, the dazzling Istana Nural Iman palace is situated in Brunei's capital, Bandar Seri Begawan.

It is considered the largest residential palace in the world, with 1,788 rooms, five grand swimming pools, 257 bathrooms, and a 110-car garage.

Later Brunei's newlywed royal couple, changed into more opulent evening outfits for the wedding banquet. Prince Abdul swapped his gold wedding suit for ceremonial military dress, embellished with diamond epaulettes and collar.

A hospital in Western Australia is in hot water after blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments.

The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February.

The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital has been found of continuing to operate with poorly sanitised instruments, reports ABC.

The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments 

Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon said some of the instruments were found to contain blood and human matter.

'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said.

'So this gives us great concerns. We've been told the problem's been fixed and this would suggest that it hasn't.

Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospitals public image, generating a loss of morale within its workforce.

'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said.

There has been a string of controversial incidents in the hospital, including the death of a patient last month who went into a coma.

Jared Olsen, 41, had irritable bowel syndrome and was also suspected of having Crohn's disease.

His father Phillip Olsen claimed his son was prescribed the wrong medication at Fiona Stanley Hospital.

James Robarge , 45 , from Saxtons River , Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning . He was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife , 42-year-old Kelly Robarge . Robarge has already served two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years .
-----------------------------------------------
A husband convicted of beating his wife to death after she filed for divorce has been sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.

James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. 

Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity.

The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence.

The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this

Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News.

In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.'

One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom.

'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.'

Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' 

Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday

During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days.

After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief.

According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found.

The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' 

Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood.

Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge

And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it.

However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence.

The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared.

Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan.

Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.'

Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years

Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years.

Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce.

He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' 

In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced.

Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.

Tiger Woods , back in August , Georgia , after missing the Masters last year following surgery hopes to pull of a stunning return to greatness . His girlfriend Vonn managed to come back after surgery that followed a devastating knee injury and win her 18th World Cup , a women 's record .
-----------------------------------------------
Lindsey Vonn made another appearance in Augusta on Thursday to cheer on her golfer boyfriend Tiger Woods while he goes after a fifth Masters championship after back surgery temporarily put his career on ice last year.

Woods' children weren't around this time, though. And without them, ski champ Vonn looked less like the beautiful stepmom and more like a girlfriend concerned for her struggling beau.

Vonn's sympathy should come as no surprise, not only because she is girlfriend. She's also come roaring back from her own terrible injuries.

Scroll down for video  

There for Tiger: Ski champ Lindsey Vonn looked a little teed off at the first day of the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, on Thursday as her beau Tiger made some high profile mistakes 

Not happy: Tiger tossed his driver after hitting off the ninth tee and sending the ball onto the first fairway during first round play of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Course in Augusta, Georgia Thursday

The 30-year-old's right knee has been rebuilt not once but twice. And Tiger is no doubt hoping he can pull off a feat like Vonn's breathtaking return to alpine skiing, in which she most recently won her 67th World Cup downhill skiiing championship, according to the New York Times.

Still, Vonn appeared worried as she watched Woods flash his notorious temper on a couple of errant shots as he struggled to prove he's still No. 1 worldwide--and not No. 111, where his rank plummeted following back surgery last year.

Vonn appeared to sweat it out along with Tiger after he yanked his tee shot into the adjacent first fairway and let the club fall from his hands in disgust while he stood frozen, staring incredulously at the flight of his ball.

Woods bent his third shot around a tree and onto the green before two-putting for bogey to stand seven shots behind the early pacesetter.

Been there: Vonn has struggled with her own injuries. The Olympic gold medalist has had two major knee surgeries in the last few years

Take a cue from his girlfriend: Woods can only hope to have the comeback that Vonn had. She won her 67th World Cup win and 18th season title after coming back from her second knee surgery

Holding strong: Vonn appeared tense as she watched Tiger struggle to get back into form following some early flubs on the first day of the Masters

Gathering himself, Woods pulled off a skillful shot from the pine straw, hooking the ball to the back of the green

Low scores were readily available thanks to soft greens at Augusta National Golf Club and 29 players were under par as Woods began the back nine on a warm, gentle day at Augusta.

The 39-year-old American, who missed last year's Masters after surgery, three-putted the first hole for a bogey but balanced that with a birdie at the par-five second after a great approach shot to five feet. 

He then failed to cash in at the short par-four third after a booming tee shot left him just short of the green at the 340-yard hole.

Choosing to chip rather than putt, Woods hit it strong and rolled some 15 feet by and two-putted for a disappointing par.

Not playing stepmom: On Wednesday, Vonn showed up in Augusta alongside Tiger's two children with ex-wife Elin Nordegren. On Thursday, the kids were nowhere to be seen

Standing out: Vonn watches play on at the 6th hole during Round 1 of the 79th Masters Golf Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club

Woods then bogeyed the long par-three fourth after finding the front bunker. The 14-times major winner blasted out strong and took two to get down for another bogey. A birdie at the par-five eighth got him back to level par.

But the American gave the stroke back at the ninth before making his way to the back nine and Amen Corner. 

The world's best golfers gathered on the eve of the Masters on Wednesday to take on a nine-hole course, often with their wives, girlfriends or kids as caddies, as part of the Par 3 Contest.

And it seemed that golf WAG and U.S. skier Lindsey Vonn appeared to be the only caddie to have opted out of the bland, white jumpsuit uniform.

Tiger Woods showed up to the event at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, with his two children, Sam, 8, and Charlie, 6, and his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn, who was dressed in a floor-length, spaghetti strap gown, accessorized with diamonds and Louis Vuitton.

Playing stepmom: Seen here Thursday, Vonn holds up her dress from the grass as she talks to Woods's children, Charlie (center) and Sam (right)

Vonn's dress appeared to pool on the grass as she spoke to Tiger, standing next to U.S. golfer Steve Stricker. She chose not to wear the requisite white caddie outfit that Tiger's children and the other caddie's wore during Wednesday's par 3 event

Locations in Ceredigion , Powys and Pembrokeshire being used for training . Also used to radicalise Mulsims , according to counter-terrorism officer . He said those involved are ` seemingly normal ' but have an ` ulterior motive '
-----------------------------------------------
Terrorists are undergoing training in rural areas of west Wales, it has emerged.

Locations in Ceredigion, Powys and Pembrokeshire are also being used to radicalise Muslims, according to an officer from the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit.

Those involved in such activities 'take part in seemingly ordinary activities' in the community but 'have an ulterior motive', Detective Constable Gareth Jones said.

Training: Locations in Ceredigion, Powys and Pembrokeshire in west Wales, illustrated above, are being used to radicalise Muslims, according to an officer from the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit

Speaking to Ceredigion Council, DC Jones stressed that issues surrounding terrorism were not confined to large cities. 

Incidents of Islamic extremist activity in Wales can be traced back to 1998, when it is claimed hate preacher Abu Hamza sent a group of 10 extremists to train in the Brecon Beacons, in Powys.

The area is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its rugged terrain helps prepare soldiers, including elite forces personnel like the SAS, physically and mentally for warfare.

In 2005, two of the 7/7 bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, were photographed white water rafting at the National Whitewater Centre in Bala, North Wales.

Five years later, three would-be terrorists from Cardiff were arrested as part of an Al-Qaeda inspired gang who plotted a 'Mumbai-style' series of terror attacks on Britain.

'These people do turn up and take part in seemingly ordinary activities, but they do have an ulterior motive. This does happen in Ceredigion.'

DC Jones added that community intelligence was important to authorities. 

He said: 'It really is vital that if any intelligence comes from the community that we look at it. We don't want that intelligence to drop off.'

ISIS has seized control of large parts of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Syria . An estimated 18,000 refugees are trapped between militant groups and regime forces . U.N. : `` In the horror that is Syria , the Yarmouk refugee camp is the deepest circle of hell ''
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)They took Yarmouk by storm, a sea of masked men flooding into the streets of one the world's most beleaguered places.

Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area.

"They slaughtered them in the streets," one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. "They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp."

An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in "the deepest circle of hell," in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict.

The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012.

The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups.

Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go.

Hundreds have been injured, but the camp's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling.

As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived.

"We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities," Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. "The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there's really nothing functioning."

Opinion: Save the 'miracle babies'

Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation's water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups.

The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help.

"According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014" during the Syrian regime's siege of the camp, the PLHR's Salim Salamah told CNN.

Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government's stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands.

But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death.

"Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime," the Yarmouk resident told CNN.

"The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp," he said. "And ISIS, I don't know ... they didn't do anything except [rename] Yarmouk Camp as 'Yarmouk Islamic State.'"

Based on the novel by Walter Tevis, the 1976 film starred Bowie as a humanoid who lands on Earth in search of water for his parched planet and becomes enamored with alcohol and television.

Flashback: David Bowie is returning to The Man Who Fell To Earth by penning a new stage version and original songs for a production on New York's Broadway later this year. The 1976 cult film marked his debut in movies

Cult classic: Bowie played an alien who was in search of water on Earth but fell in love with television

Bowie, 68, is not expected to perform in the production, titled Lazarus, which he has written with award-winning playwright Enda Walsh, who wrote the hit Broadway musical Once. 

According to sources connected to the adaptation, it has been in the works for years. 

The show will be spearheaded by Dutch Ivo van Hove, who used Bowie's music in one of his own productions last year.

But the production team has cryptically refused to define it.

'It's going to be a play with characters and songs - I'm calling it music theater, but I don't really know what it's going to be like, I just have incredible trust in their creative vision,' James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, told the New York Times. 

'I'm really excited about it. These are three very different sensibilities to be colliding.'

The Man Who Fell to Earth was the first movie for Bowie but he did not write the music amid contractual disputes, instead leaving the task to singer-songwriter John Phillips from The Mamas And The Papas.

Adaptation: The movie was an adaptation of the Walter Tevis novel of the same name, published in 1963

Tweaks: It is not clear what changes will be made in the stage version, Lazarus, by Bowie and Enda Walsh

It has been in the works for years, according to New York Theater Workshop artistic director James Nicola

New direction? The team has refused to categorize the new production as either a play or a musical

Bowie has long been fascinated by space and science fiction, emerging on the scene in 1969 with his astronaut anthem Space Oddity and later writing the probing Life On Mars?

Bowie studied acting and is known for his portrayal on Broadway in 1980-81 of severely deformed Englishman Joseph Merrick in The Elephant Man.

Bowie, 68, kept quiet for a decade before releasing the album The Next Day in 2013.

He last year released the career-spanning collection Nothing Has Changed with new material.

Lord Tebbit said figures such as Churchill had careers before politics . He claimed Mr Cameron was a PR advisor as well as a special advisor . Lord Tebbit was an airline pilot before he embarked on his political career . He said : ` I just can not read Mr Cameron 's mind . It 's a foreign country to me '
-----------------------------------------------
Lord Tebbit has hit out at David Cameron for not being a ‘real man’ with ‘real depth of experience’.

The former Tory party chairman said that unlike major figures such as Sir Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or Aneurin Bevan, Mr Cameron had never had a ‘proper job’.

Instead, he said the Prime Minister had done nothing except be a special adviser and working in PR for Carlton Television.

Lord Tebbit, pictured, launched an astonishing attack on David Cameron claiming the PM has never had a proper job before entering politics unlike Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or even Aneurin Bevan

Lord Tebbit, a former airline pilot, also criticised Mr Cameron’s tactics in playing up the threat of a Labour-SNP government, and even suggested Tory voters north of the border vote tactically for Labour.

He told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I just cannot read Mr Cameron’s mind. It’s a foreign country to me.

‘Men like Churchill, Atlee, Bevan, were real men with real depths of experience.

‘They had not gone from school to university to being a special adviser to working in an advertising agency.’

He added: ‘He doesn’t have that hinterland of experience any more than Mr Miliband.’

Lord Tebbit also suggested that Mr Cameron’s campaign tactics were pushing people into the arms of the SNP and Ukip.

Lord Tebbit accused Mr Cameron, pictured, of bungling the Scottish referendum and annoying English voters

‘Having bungled the Scottish referendum, it seems pointless to just irritate Scots by shouting at them from Westminster,’ the former Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher said.

‘The English are irritated into voting for Ukip, by being shouted at from Westminster – and the Scots are irritated similarly.’

Lord Tebbit also told The Guardian it was ‘logical’ for Scots to vote tactically for Labour in areas where Conservative candidates stand no chance.

‘From the Tories’ point of view we are not going to come home with a vast number of seats from Scotland,’ he said. ‘We know that.

‘So the choice is would we rather have a Scot Nat or Labour? I think, on balance, probably a Labour MP would be a more reasonable thing to have.’

Meanwhile Madonna was criticised by her gay fanbase yesterday for paying ‘unapologetic’ tribute to Margaret Thatcher – who brought in legislation to ban the ‘promotion’ of homosexuality.

The 56-year-old singer posted an image of the Iron Lady on photo-sharing website Instagram along with the caption ‘Thank you Margaret Thatcher’ followed by ‘unapologetic’ and a reference to her latest album, Rebel Heart. But the post was hurriedly removed after her gay fans reminded her that Mrs Thatcher’s ‘anti-gay’ legislation was only overturned in 2003.

Matilda Kahl , an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi , owns 15 of the same white shirt and several pairs of plain black trousers . She has just had to invest in 15 new shirts from Zara because the others are now too worn to wear but has no other plans to change her ` uniform '
-----------------------------------------------
A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. 

Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.'

In an article for Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction.

Empowering: Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform'

'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. 

'[I kept thinking], "Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.'

Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all.

'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 

'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' 

Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. 

Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers

She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. 

She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days.

'I’ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 

'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 

'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.'

With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. 

All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair

But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers.

She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing.

But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?'

Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before?

'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 

'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.'

According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices. 'People have really put it to the test, and I’m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I’m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains.

All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money– and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control.

Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe.

'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I’d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I’m not here for the uniform.'

She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them.

'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'

Kentucky player mutters N-word under his breath about a Wisconsin player at postgame news conference . Andrew Harrison , who is black , tweets that he apologized to Frank Kaminsky , who is white . Kaminsky says he 's talked it over with Harrison -- ` I 'm over it ''
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)A University of Kentucky basketball player is apologizing for the "poor choice of words" he muttered under his breath after the team's stunning loss to Wisconsin on Saturday.

As a deflated panel of Wildcats fielded a reporter's question about Wisconsin standout Frank Kaminsky, a hot mic picked up Kentucky guard Andrew Harrison saying of Kaminsky, "F**k that (N-word)."

Harrison, who is is black, said his words were "in jest," and that he meant no disrespect to Kaminsky, who is white.

"First I want to apologize for my poor choice of words used in jest towards a player I respect and know," Harrison tweeted. "When I realized how this could be perceived I immediately called big frank to apologize and let him know I didn't mean any disrespect."

Kaminsky -- the 2015 Associated Press player of the year -- said Sunday that he was "over it."

"He reached out to me. We talked about it. [I'm] Over it," he said. "Nothing needs to be made out of it."

Harrison said he wished Kaminsky well in Monday's national title game against Duke.

"We had a good conversation, and I wished him good luck in the championship game Monday."

CNN reached out to Kentucky for comment on Sunday but did not hear back.

Model Karlie Kloss is spreading her passion for computer coding and empowering young women by teaming up with the Flatiron School in New York to offer teen girls around the country scholarships to the academy's software engineering program this summer.

The 22-year-old's Kode With Karlie scholarships will provide 20 girls between the ages of 13 and 18 free tuition to the same two-week coding course she took last year at the Flatiron Pre-College Academy. 

'Code is only going to continue to play a major role in defining our future,' she says in a video promoting Kode With Karlie. 'I think it's crucial that young women learn to code as early as possible to ensure that we [...] have a voice and a stake in what the world looks like.'

Team player: The 22-year-old model was filmed working with other students at the Flatiron School in New York, where her scholarship recipients will be taking a two week software engineering program

Karlie is donating $20,000 of her own money for the classes, which cost $2,000 per student, while the Flatiron school has offered to match her contribution. 

The blonde beauty, who describes herself as a 'model, ballerina and cookie expert' in the clip, explains that she learned how 'creative coding truly is' when she studied it last summer.

'Similar to dance and fashion, coding is a form of self-expression,' she says. 'It's a way to turn a cool, innovative idea into a product, website, app, tool or experience.' 

Karlie says it was this revelation that inspired her to share her passion with other girls across the country. 

Major revelation: Karlie attended the coding course, which costs $2,000 per student, last year

Completed project: Karlie and other students watched their hard work pay off as their creation took flight 

After the course, her 20 scholarship recipients will understand the 'building blocks of coding' and have already built and deployed their own app to the web.

In order to apply for the scholarship, female students are asked to film a 60 second video explaining how they plan to use their 'coding super powers' after they complete the course. 

Karlie took to social media yesterday to promote the opportunity, tweeting: 'Who runs the world? CODERS! Apply for the #KodeWithKarlie Scholarship @FlatironSchool for your chance to learn code! [sic]' 

And it's clear that Karlie, who also co-founded Karlie’s Kookies with chef and owner of Milk Bar Christina Tosi, takes her entrepreneurial roles and studies seriously.  

Stellar student: Karlie can be seen working with other students at the software engineering class last summer 

Combined interests: The blonde beauty can be seen speaking on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas

In February, it was announced that she was hanging up her Angel wings and leaving Victoria's Secret to focus on other business opportunities, as well as her classes at New York University.

The model will be starting college at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study in the fall, where she will study computer coding.

Karlie, who covered the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine that she 'definitely could not get a job as a coder yet'.

Catwalk queen: Karlie can be seen strutting down the runway at the Tom Ford show (L) and the Atelier Versace haute couture show (R) earlier this year

'But it is something I am fascinated by, even if it is not the profession I choose,' she added.

Karlie continued: 'Simply having the comprehension of the way that it works, having the ability to speak that language and to be able to not only comprehend it, but write and build something – the world is built on code.'

And Karlie has no problem blending her two worlds together.  

Last month, she spoke on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas.

Prince Charles and Camilla will celebrate their anniversary later this week . The couple were married in April 2005 after their engagement in February . In 2005 , only seven per cent of people thought Camilla should be Queen . Almost half are in favour of Queen Camilla when Charles takes the throne .
-----------------------------------------------
Nearly half of the British public believe the Duchess of Cornwall should become Queen Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne.

A new poll by YouGov ahead of Charles and Camilla's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think Camilla should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king, while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were undecided.

When the Prince and Camilla became engaged in February 2005, only 7 per cent of people polled by YouGov thought Camilla should one day be Queen.

Almost half of all Britons believe Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, should become Queen when Prince Charles accedes to the throne although 35 per cent believe she should be rewarded with a lesser title

Half of those polled believe that Camilla, right, does a good job of carrying out her official duties

Aides have always insisted the Duchess does not want to be known as Queen and intends to be known as Princess Consort instead.

But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become Queen no matter what title she actually uses.

Most people (42 per cent) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of Camilla, with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one.

But the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed Camilla was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch, 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know.

Of those questioned, 50 per cent thought Camilla had carried out her duties as Duchess of Cornwall well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well. Only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role. Some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know.

Nicola Wildash, research executive at YouGov, suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to Camilla, rather than a large surge in popularity.

'The further we get from Diana's death, the less that will resonate in people's minds. As soon as the public see something for years and years, they become more neutralised to the issue,' she said.

Prince Charles, left, and Camilla, right, are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary

Figures from YouGov in June last year showed 53 per cent thought Camilla should one day become Queen Consort, 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know.

But Ms Wildash said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation.

Almost two fifths (39 per cent) said they believed the Queen was happy with Camilla's performance as the Duchess of Cornwall, with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy.

Regarding Charles, 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as Prince of Wales better than he did 10 years ago, while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago.

But 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly.

Jimmy Anderson claimed his 381st Test wicket on Tuesday in Antigua . The 32-year-old dismissed Devon Smith for 10 on day two of first Test . Anderson is still two wickets behind Sir Ian Botham 's record of 383 . Chris Jordan says that the record is ` just around the corner '
-----------------------------------------------
England's premier bowler Jimmy Anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country's all-time leading wicket taker in his 100th Test appearance in Antigua.

But pace attack colleague Chris Jordan believes the Anderson family celebration party is 'just around the corner' as West Indies fell to 155 for four in response to England's first-innings total of 399.

Anderson, watched by his parents, wife, two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great Sir Ian Botham's haul of 383, claimed only one early victim in West Indies opener Devon Smith in his 13 overs, which went for 24 runs and eight maidens.

Jimmy Anderson moved to within two wickets of Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets

Anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first Test in Antigua

But even the England back-room staff were surprised that Anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall. It could have been better but a Ben Stokes wicket was ruled a no ball.

Jordan took a stunning slip catch off Tredwell to dismiss West Indies vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who claimed after play that he thought Anderson ' looked tired'.

But Jordan said: 'Jimmy got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up, which I thought we did pretty well. If he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner.

Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Darren Bravo on the second afternoon

Jordan appeals for an lbw against West Indian batsman Kraigg Brathwaite, but it was unsuccessful

'The stat is obviously there but I don't think Jimmy or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently.

'We're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure.

'As a group we try and win every session, so we'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail.'

Ironically, No 11 Anderson and Jordan were the pick of the lower-order England batsman in a last-wicket partnership of 38 as the West Indies bowling attack, inspired by a talk from bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose, captured the last five wickets for 58.

West Indies opener Brathwaite did a good job of seeing off Anderson in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39, he enjoyed the test.

Jordan later took a stunning catch at first slip off Tredwell's bowling to dismiss Brathwaite

'Obviously when Anderson started with the new ball it was moving a lot, so facing him then was a little more challenging.

'But obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so I don't know if maybe he was a little bit tired.

'It was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways. The key is to keep as still as possible.'

Brathwaite's knock would probably have lasted longer had anyone other than the athletic Jordan been stationed at slip, where he claimed a superb one-handed catch inches off the ground.

Jordan is, of course, Barbados born - a fact not lost on Brathwaite.

'It was CJ who caught me, a fella from here, so it was quite unlucky.'

About his catch, Jordan said: ' It was a reaction one but it rivals my best at this level.'
