Forget sunbathing, now you can spend your holiday learning to strip. 

Burlesque queen Dita Von Teese is offering burlesque workshops at Canyon Ranch, a luxury health resort in Tucson, Arizona. 

With an emphasis on self-confidence boosting, the forty two-year-old fashion designer and author famous for her raunchy routines will run presentations and classes incorporating the principles of modern burlesque - the 'art form' she famously revived.

Dita von Teese will offer guests at the Canyon Ranch an insight into the glamorous world of burlesque

Sensuality & the Art of the Teese with Dita Von Teese will invite female guests to unleash their inner divas with a selection of workshops and classes.

Von Teese, real name Heather Renée Sweet, will team up with burlesque teacher Catherine D'Lish, to offer ranch guests a striptease workshop. 

From June 8 until June 12, holidaymakers to the ranch - more famous for holistic body treatments than nipple tassels - can learn classic moves such as the 'burlesque strut' as well as how to artfully remove garters, gloves and stockings.

Instead of hitting the resort's fitness centre, plucky holidaymakers can take part in a Fit Strip class, hosted by Von Teese herself, along with fitness staff from the ranch. 

And for those wanting a deeper understanding of American burlesque, which first gained popularity as early as 1860, there will be history sessions, during which Von Teese will show guests treasured items from her personal collection of memorabilia. 

'We are thrilled that Dita chose to lead her first-ever burlesque workshop at Canyon Ranch in Tucson,' Canyon Ranch's director of public relations told Mail Online Travel. 

More oo-er than ohm: Von Teese believes her burlesque workshops can build women's confidence

Finding peace: Canyon Ranch health resort in Tuscon is an 150 acre haven in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona

'We are confident that this program will appeal to our current guests as well as those who’ve never before visited Canyon Ranch.'

Von Teese told the New York Times: 'It really has nothing to do with my performance, but more to do with sharing where my motivations and confidence come from, and trying to explain what it is about burlesque that’s become such a uniquely modern feminist movement.'

A five-night stay at Canyon Ranch costs $5,460 (around £3565) per person  including accommodation, meals, airport transfers and spa treatments and unlimited classes.

Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola says his team's injury situation is 'critical, very critical' ahead of the Bundesliga match against Eintracht Frankfurt and the Champions League quarter final game against FC Porto.

Guardiola spoke after defender Mehdi Benatia was ruled out for up to four weeks with a hamstring injury. 

Wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery and midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger, David Alaba and Javi Martinez are also sidelined.

Guardiola had only 14 healthy players at Friday's practice.

The Spaniard said he was not sure 'how long we can live with this situation,' adding that 'we are tired.'

Bayern need four more wins to secure the Bundesliga title. Guardiola's team visits Porto on Wednesday.

The former Barcelona manager has suggested that his team is shackled by the absence of Ribery and Robben.

'Without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, we are a different team,' Guardiola said after the German Cup semi-final .

Ribery (left) is absent with an ankle injury while Robben is out until May with a stomach muscle tear

'Of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one-on-one situations. We have other players and have to adapt the game for them.'

Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of March. 

Ribery has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of Munich's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto.

Kristina, who works with special needs kids, takes glamorous photos of her daughter playing in the park and wearing her colorful new outfits.

'It's become kind of an addiction. Since we live so close, we base our visits off one or two outfits, ‘Kristina told Today.

Kristina is so inspired by her daughter that she started a Facebook page called Giselle's Garden that features her 4-year-old princess in her whimsical attire.

Kristina told Today that her photos have been extremely well received.

'I'm not trying to be biased, but I think my daughter is beautiful. I think she's as beautiful as any other 4-year-old. I just want her to be treated the same way. She could be a model in her photos,' she said.

Kristina first learned to sew when Giselle started playing dress up in store bought clothing and didn't like wearing the itchy tulle material.

Spreading her wings: Dressing up in costumes and visiting the park has given Giselle more confidence 

All smiles: Giselle was once very quiet but after her many visits to Disney World and becoming comfortable with the spotlight she smiles at people and even gives them a high five

So far Giselle has played many princess roles including those of Princess Jasmine, Cinderella and Tinkerbell.

She also liked playing boy characters such as Mike Wazowski from Monster's Inc. and the little boy from Up.

When Giselle and Kristina visit the theme park they don't go to all the attractions, instead they feed ducks and visit  some Disney characters.

Kristina said that Disney World has helped her daughter feel more comfortable around other people and act less shy.

Giselle once never said a word but now she waves to people and even high fives them.

New fashions: Kristina said she first started sewing for her daughter when Giselle started playing dress-up and couldn't tolerate the scratchy tulle textures

Magic everywhere: Giselle captures heartwarming and truly magical moments with her daughter Giselle 

Like a model: Kristina says that he daughter looks like a real model in the photos she takes of her and that her beautiful soul shines through in each photo

'She just blossomed. I don't have any other words to describe it — she is a flower and she just burst into blooming when we got there,' Kristina told The Huffington Post.

'It was insane. And now we're obsessed with going because that's when we get to see her at her best.'

Kristina says that she learns from her own daughter every day and that she is now able to help other families who have children with special needs.

'I love that I can offer sessions to families with special needs who may be afraid to take their kids to a photographer who wouldn't be used to working with children like that,' she said.

Kristina values her daughter's unique beauty, happiness, and Disney princess spirit.

'This has been a very fun learning experience for us. She's definitely taught us to slow down and savor every moment, and really look into finding the beauty in things,' she said.

'I'm just trying to make sure I capture her doing all this stuff when she's young, and we don't have too many worries going on and we're all just having a good time. There's really not any philosophical reason, other than I thought it would all be pretty.'

Manchester City may be still licking their wounds from their derby day mauling at bitter rivals Manchester United on Sunday, but the reigning Premier League champions looked in determined mood as they trained on Wednesday.

Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base.

Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham

City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus

Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer

Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season.

The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer.

And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises.

In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure.

Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season.

Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United

'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said.

'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.'

'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why

Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season.

The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too.

Samantha Simmonds , 42 , took time off work to spend with her children . But Easter holiday turned into a string of tantrums and bickering , she said . Mother-of-three also describes ` working mum guilt ' shared by many .
-----------------------------------------------
In her working life, she has covered terrorist attacks, murders and explosions.

But nothing, it seems, has been a greater challenge for Samantha Simmonds than a car journey with her three children.

The Sky newsreader has revealed how an Easter holiday outing with her family saw ‘blood and saliva flying’ between her boisterous sons in the backseat – and ended with her six-year-old having a tooth knocked out.

Butter wouldn’t melt! Samantha Simmonds and husband Phillip Davies with their children, two, four and six 

In a searingly honest account that plenty of exhausted parents will relate to, Miss Simmonds, 42, described how she took some time off work to spend with her children – but said the break turned into a string of tantrums and bickering.

Miss Simmonds is married to Phillip Davies, the owner of online auction business Flogit4u, and the couple have a daughter aged two and sons aged four and six.

Describing a trip back from Manchester to London, the newsreader wrote on her blog that four hours into a fraught journey, her six-year-old son started screaming.

She said: ‘I turned round to see blood and saliva flying towards me and all over [the six-year-old’s] face. I started yelling in shock and shouted to the four-year-old, “What have you done?”

‘What he had done was knock one of his brother’s teeth out! How is that even possible?’ After ‘one packet of wet wipes, a lot of blood and tears’, she wrote, the situation was calmer, and it wasn’t long before her enterprising son was negotiating more money from the tooth fairy ‘due to blood loss and trauma’.

Honest: In her blog post, the Sky newsreader and mother-of-three also describes ‘working mum guilt’

The newsreader – who has worked for Channel 5 and BBC News as well as Sky – said she struggled to cope when the boys turned on each other in the car.

‘On their own they are all gorgeous – a delight – a pleasure! Together they are a ticking time bomb,’ she wrote. ‘Just how long before the first verbal or physical punch is thrown is anyone’s guess. It is this – the dynamics of the three of them all together that I find the single hardest thing about being a parent … I feel unprepared and frustratingly un-forewarned of the trials and tribulations of dealing with my children en masse.’

In the post, which does not give her children’s names, she also describes the ‘working mum guilt’ shared by many, and how she tries to squeeze in as many activities as possible during precious time off.

‘Many would argue I do too much …. that may well be so, but I genuinely love our outings and seeing the joy and wonder on their faces,’ she wrote. But the dream can quickly turn into a nightmare when ‘their testosterone-fuelled little bodies means they cannot keep their hands off each other for more than a few minutes at a time’.

She added: ‘Either kicking one another while sitting on the sofa, or wrestling around the house and taking it in turn to jump on each other’s heads – our two-year-old daughter included.

‘Pre parenthood, like many childless adults I would stare agog in the streets and in restaurants – at the out of control parent screaming at their equally out of control children … Oh how easy it is to judge! I am now that parent!’

Linda Thompson, Bruce Jenner's second wife, has praised her former husband for being 'a champion for those who share the struggle to just be who they are.'

She tweeted her message of support and pride just hours before Bruce's highly-anticipated  sit down interview with Diane Sawyer is set to air on ABC.

It's the first public comment the former beauty queen, who was married to the Olympic gold medalist from 1981 to 1986, has made about his rumored transition from male to female.

Scroll down for video 

Breaking her silence: Bruce Jenner's second wife Linda Thompson tweeted a message of support for the Olympian ahead of his ABC prime time special with Diane Sawyer set to air on Friday night

Supportive and proud: Linda, 64, has said her former husband's anticipated confirmation that he's transgender and plans to live as a woman is as monumental as his Olympic success

Linda shared two pictures of the former decathlete, one of him celebrating his victory at the Montreal Olympics in 1976 and one of his sporting image on a billboard.

She compared his expected revelations about his personal journey to the magnitude of what he accomplished as an athlete. 

Linda had two sons with Bruce - Brandon and Brody - and both have been seen in teaser videos released by the TV network suggesting they are also supportive of their father's transition.

Second time around: The star athlete met Linda Thompson as his first marriage crumbled and as soon as his divorce was finalized in January 1981, he and Linda tied the knot in Hawaii

Real man: A shirtless Bruce happily posed on the cover of Playgirl in 1982 with  Linda, as he continued to reap the rewards of his Olympic success

A former beauty queen and an ex-girlfriend of Elvis Presley, Linda and Bruce tied the knot in a beach ceremony in Hawaii on January 5, 1981.

The two had started seeing each other while the Olympian was still legally married to his first wife Chrystie and married as soon as his divorce was finalized.

They led a glamorous Hollywood lifestyle and were fixtures on the celebrity circuit.

Linda starred in the Hee Haw TV series and had small parts in other TV shows and films while Bruce worked as a TV commentator and actor, appearing in six episodes of CHiPS and the Village People movie Can't Stop The Music.

In 1982, the couple posed for the cover of Playgirl with Bruce shirtless alongside his curvaceous wife.

Following their divorce in 1986, Linda went on to marry prolific music producer David Foster, from whom she was divorced in 2005, and became a celebrated songwriter in her own right.

Proud mama: Linda shared this photo of herself with her sons Brody, 31, and Brandon, 33, Jenner on on April 6

It's been reported previously that Bruce has said that he told both his first two ex-wives, when their divorces were finalized, that he's known since childhood that he should really be living as a woman.

There have also been persistent stories over the years about the former star athlete's penchant for wearing women's clothes. 

Bombshell claims surfaced Friday suggesting Bruce had, in fact, started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s, following his divorce from Linda, but had stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife.

Entertainment Tonight, quoting 'a source with direct knowledge,' said Bruce, now 65, had allegedly started hormone therapy and electrolysis and had had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine. 

A spokesperson for the father of six declined to comment on the report after being contacted by DailyMail.com Friday morning.

Glamorous couple: Both Bruce and Linda worked as actors in Hollywood and were fixtures on the celebrity circuit in Tinseltown during their five year marriage 

His first wife Chrystie Crownover, who he married straight out of college in 1972, expressed her support for her ex a little earlier this year as rumors started swirling about his changing appearance and his possible gender reassignment.

'I just want him to be happy,' said Chrystie who has two children with Bruce, Burt and Cassandra.

'He is a very proud and present grandfather. We all support him.'

Third wife Kris Jenner, mother of his daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, has yet to speak publicly about what's going on with Bruce.

Her daughter Kim Kardashian told reporters Friday in New York that the family will be sitting down together to watch his TV revelations.

Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School

Local Leeton parents have expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott.

A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids.

'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong.

Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].'

Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. 

This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed.

Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week.

Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer.

School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday.

The 26-year-old Leeton High School teacher was allegedly murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years.

NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports.

Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. 

It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests.

The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby.

It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family.

On Saturday - the day which English and drama teacher Ms Scott was set to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley - a memorial was held to honour the late bride-to-be.

In a poignant move, the memorial service took place at the same time as when her wedding ceremony was due to take place. 

Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton.

The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher.

'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday.

'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her.

'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.'

Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was too upset to take the stage, but was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life.

A vigil has been created at the school where the popular 26-year-old teacher taught drama and English

Newport Gwent Dragons reached the European Challenge Cup semi-finals with a thrilling 25-21 victory over Cardiff Blues.

Tries from wing Hallam Amos, replacement Nic Cudd, a penalty try plus penalties from Tom Prydie and Dorian Jones and two Prydie conversions brought the Dragons back from a big deficit to victory.

Scrum-half Lloyd Williams, fly-half Gareth Anscombe and number eight Josh Navidi crossed for the Blues, while Anscombe added three conversions.

Dragons replacement Nic Cudd powers over for try against Cardiff at Rodney Parade 

The draw could not have set-up a more mouth-watering Welsh clash than this encounter between the old rivals, with an away trip to either London Irish or Edinburgh the reward for the victors.

Cardiff held the upper hand historically, having won the Challenge Cup in 2010 when beating French outfit Toulon 28-21, while the furthest the Dragons had gone in Europe's second tournament was the semi-final stage.

The Blues fielded a lot of their big guns, including Wales captain Sam Warburton, while the home region curiously left star British Lions number eight Taulupe Faletau on the bench.

The visitors came out of the blocks with a blast, forcing the Dragons onto the defensive over their own line. From the attacking scrum five, the ball found its way to Williams to cross by the post and make Anscombe's conversion easy.

Prydie reduced the arrears when landing a long-range penalty but the Dragons suffered the loss of international ace Andrew Coombs with a bad leg injury, bringing Faletau into the fray to the loud cheers of the crowd.

It was a real cut and thrust affair but the Blues played with far more cohesion and they came up trumps again when, again from a scrum five, the ball went to Anscombe who drove through weak tackling to the line and again converted.

The Dragons did themselves no favours with an average kicking game as the Blues found the spaces and pushed them back.

But the home side pulled themselves back to within four points of the Blues at half-time when Amos was put away by scrum-half Jonathan Evans under the posts, with Prydie converting.

A thorn in the Dragons side was opposition wing Alex Cuthbert, who forced the home defence into multiple tackles - including one from full-back Jason Tovey, whose thumping hit prevented a possible runaway touchdown.

The Dragons took it to the Blues after the break as an attacking line-out set up a series of thrusts to the visiting line before Cudd saw a gap and went over just seconds after coming on for flanker James Thomas.

Prydie's conversion hit the post but the home side were on top and went in front for the first time when a clearance attempt a few metres from his line by Lloyd Williams was charged down and, as it crossed the line, a try was infringed.

Referee JP Doyle had no hesitation in running under the posts for a penalty try, easily converted by Prydie - with Williams earning 10 minutes in the bin.

A penalty from Dorian Jones further increased the Dragons' lead - but the vsitors would not give up.

From a series of scrums on the home line, Navidi picked up and went by the posts with Anscombe's conversion reducing the deficit to four points.

However, the Dragons survived an onslaught in the dying minutes to hold on for the victory.

Tamara Pacskowska, who posed as a wealthy pensioner to try and sell a £1million Bayswater mews house from under the owner's nose

A Polish conwoman who posed as a wealthy pensioner to try and sell a £1million house from under the owner's nose wept as she avoided jail today.

Tamara Pacskowska pretended to be 76-year-old Georgina Bagnall-Oakley at meetings with estate agents and solicitors in November last year over sale of the home in Bayswater, West London.

The 56-year-old, from Croydon, South London, could not speak English and took her daughter-in-law Monika Brzezinska, 34, along with her on the visits to help her translate.

The fraudsters were eventually caught out in a solicitors office while they were on the cusp of completing the sale of the house to fellow conman, 26-year-old Benjamin Khoury,

Today at Southwark Crown Court, Pacskowska sobbed as she was given a community order and made to pay costs after previously admitting fraud.

Mother-of-three Brzezinska, who also wept throughout the hearing, and Khoury, were also spared jail after they too admitted a fraud charge.

Brzezinska thanked the judge after the sentence was passed while Khoury grinned in the dock.

Pacskowska used a fake driving licence and passport bearing her photograph and Mrs Bagnall-Oakeley’s name and details in the scam.

She claims she was offered £3,000 to pose as the owner of the property by a woman allegedly named Amisha Singh.

Khoury, of German-Israeli heritage who lives in Hackney, east London, charged prospective buyers £50 to show them around the house and also had paperwork relating to the property in his bedroom.

Mrs Bagnall-Oakley bought the property in Clarendon Mews in 1982 with her husband Hugo and it was transferred solely to her name in 2014. She was renting it out at the time.

The victim said she was left feeling ‘vulnerable, apprehensive and anxious’ after she discovered someone had tried to steal her identity.

In a statement to the court, she said: ‘My initial reaction upon learning about the fraud was that of shock that this could so nearly have succeeded.

‘My identity had been stolen and left me feeling vulnerable, apprehensive and anxious.

‘I would not wish this on anyone in the future.’

Monkia Brzezinska, Pacskowska's daughter-in-law, left, and Bejamin Khoury, who also admitted fraud, also escaped jail 

Prosecutor Peter Zinner described the scam as an ‘audacious and sophisticated’ attempt to steal the property, valued at about £950,000.

He said: 'In so adopting the sole owner’s identity, purported to be the vendor of the property and instructed solicitors to sell the property for that sum and it was only the subsequent intervention of the police just before completion of the sale that prevented the property from being sold from under the owner’s feet.'

All three defendants were sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended for two years, ordered to carry out unpaid work and pay £250 each towards prosecution costs.

Judge Michael Grieve QC added: ‘It’s not easy to establish your roles in these offences.

‘One is left to wonder how there could ever have been a realistic prospect of Mrs Pacskowska, who is Polish and speaks little if any English, passing herself off as Georgina Bagnall-Oakeley to the satisfaction of a qualified solicitor.

The £1million house in Clarendon Mews, Bayswater, which the group had tried to sell from under owner Georgina Bagnall-Oakley's nose 

‘Ms Brzezinska I can only conclude that your role was to support and interpret for your mother-in-law.

‘It’s absolutely clear that there were others who lay behind this fraud who would have substantially benefitted from it and who used you to open yourselves up to high risk for relatively little reward.

‘You took part willingly and for financial gain and provided photographs to be used on false driving licences and passports.

‘Others played leading roles in this fraud which on one view was a very sophisticated property fraud.

‘But your mission was doomed to failure.

 The victim said she was left feeling ‘vulnerable, apprehensive and anxious’ after she discovered someone had tried to steal her identity to sell her home, pictured

‘There was an anonymous tip-off to the solicitors who alerted the police and officers then lay in wait for you in November.’

He added: ‘The value of the sale and intended loss to the victim, a 76-year-old lady, is put at just short of £1million.

‘An elderly lady stood to lose almost £1million through the theft of her property.

‘She speaks of the vulnerability that the theft of another person’s identity can cause.’

The sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in Raqqa . It warns ISIS jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear . Leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonment .
-----------------------------------------------
Fashion-conscious militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have been dealt a blow after their commanders banned them wearing products made by Nike.

The sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa warning ISIS jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear.

The news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of Nike among ISIS fighters, comparing the brand's name and famous 'tick' logo to wearing a Christian cross.

His comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear Nike products because they are 'comfy and good quality, unlike crosses'.

Not allowed: The leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonmen

Images of the leaflet banning Nike clothing was shared online by the activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who translated it from Arabic.

They said Nike was singled out because of its associations with the Greek goddess of the same name and because the word apparently sounds similar to phrases of a sexual nature in Arabic.

The leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonment. 

This is despite the fact one of the group's most famous commanders, Abu Waheeb, is well known for wearing Western sportswear, including items made by Nike and Adidas.

The argument that senior ISIS militants still wear Nike products is unlikely to be considered much of a defence for the millions of brutally oppressed citizens living under the rule of the Islamic State. 

Fashion-conscious: The ban comes despite the fact one of the group's most famous commanders, Abu Waheeb, is well known for wearing Western sportswear, including items made by Nike and Adidas

The wearing of Nike products has long been contentious among ISIS jihadis, due to the fact the name was inspired by a Greek goddess and reportedly sound like several words of a sexual nature in Arabic 

The news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of Nike among ISIS fighters, comparing the brand's famous 'tick' logo to wearing a Christian cross. His comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear Nike products because they are 'comfortable'

A recent ban of men wearing jeans - apparently because the clothing 'provokes sexual desire, and shows the attractions of men's body' - has been strictly enforced.

In fact some young men seen wearing jeans after the ban was put in place were reportedly told they must exchange their denim products for pyjamas, or face time in prison.

As well as products made by Nike, numerous other items of clothing appear on the leaflet. Newly-banned products on the list include anything carrying swear words or sexual phrases.

To help non-English speakers recognise the banned terms, the ISIS leaflet helpfully provides a long list of swear words alongside their Arabic translation. 

Nike did not respond to a request for comment on the ban.

Astrophysicist Amy Mainzer named an asteroid after Malala Yousafzai . Mainzer discovered Malala 's asteroid in June 2010 . Asteroid 316201 Malala circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space.

A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school.

It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause.

After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens.

Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it.

"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color)," Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala.

Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48.

Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. "It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."

As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential.

"We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's," Mainzer wrote.

-----------------------------------------------
Michael Bloomberg wants to be mayor again - but in London rather than New York City, according to reports.

Bloomberg, who was elected to the top Big Apple job three times in a row, has reportedly turned his sights across the Atlantic, where he dreams of replacing incumbent Boris Johnson.

According to Britain's Sunday Times, Bloomberg, 73, is 'considering' the move, and has the backing of senior officials in Britain's Conservative Party.

Scroll down for video  

Passing the torch? Michael Bloomberg, right, is pictured above with London mayor Boris Johnson. He is reportedly considering standing for Johnson's job in 2016

Bloomberg has significant business interests in the city. His Bloomberg financial information company has offices there, while he personally owns a $30million mansion.

In the past he has described London as his 'second home'. His ex-wife is a British citizen, as are his two daughters.

Though Bloomberg holds U.S. citizenship, sources told the Sunday Times that officials could arrange for a switch to make him eligible for high office.

London is due a new mayor in 2016. Boris Johnson, who was himself born in New York City, will then have held the position for eight years.

'Job swap': Johnson, right, who is seen as a future Prime Minister, once joked about swapping jobs with Bloomberg, left, who has said he thinks of London as a 'second home'

If Michael Bloomberg does become Mayor of London, it would be the latest twist in a long career which has seen him rise to the top in both business and politics.

He started his career as an investment banker with Salomon Brothers, and when he was laid off from the firm in 1981 he used his $10million payout to start his own financial information company, Bloomberg LP.

The firm is best known for the 'Bloomberg terminals' which provide real-time updates on the financial markets and are now ubiquitous on banks' trading floors.

Bloomberg has also spawned an network of news outlets including a cable TV station, financial news website and the magazine Businessweek.

In 2001, Mr Bloomberg entered politics by running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, and spent $73million of his own money getting elected.

He went on to serve 12 years as mayor, drawing praise for his businesslike management of city government, but he courted controversy with high-profile decisions such as banning smoking indoors and outlawing extra-large sodas.

Despite his repeated electoral success, Mr Bloomberg has faced opposition from the Left over his close links to Wall Street, while the Right has reacted with anger against his campaign to impose new restrictions on gun ownership across the US. 

Johnson is also standing for a seat in Britain's parliament in the country's May elections.

He has said if he wins he will stay in the mayor's job until 2016, while serving as MP for the London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the same time.

He has long been spoken of as a future Prime Minister, and was recently named by incumbent David Cameron as a potential successor.

Johnson has spoken before of the advantages of a new mayor coming in, though he could technically run for a third term.

Speaking in 2013 to London radio station LBC, he said: 'The reality is that after eight years you've been at it for a long time in a very big job.

'You see what happens to people who do things for too long. You've got to be fair to the electorate, you've got to be sure you are doing your best.

'There will come people who will have fantastic ideas and who will have fresh ways of thinking about things.'

Bloomberg and Johnson have met before - and at one meeting in 2013, Johnson even joked about doing a 'job swap' with Bloomberg - though there is no suggestion Johnson has set his sights on New York City.

A source close to Johnson told the Sunday Times: 'Mike is an enormous friend of London. He’s a great contributor to the city. He’s got many supporters and admirers of which Boris is definitely one.' 

If indeed Bloomberg decided on an unlkely run for mayor, he would have to jump through some hoops.

As an American citizen he would have to apply for British residency. This process is lengthy but can be speeded up if the person invested $15 million into the country.

This would present no difficulties for Bloomberg who is the 13th richest man in the world, worth $36 billion.

Ineed, both of Bloomberg's daughter's are British and his ex-wife is Susan Brown, is from the north of England.

George Davon Kennedy has been arrested in the case of a gang rape in Panama City Beach . He is from Murfreesboro , Tennessee , and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University . Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators . A woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped in broad daylight as bystanders watched .
-----------------------------------------------
Panama City Beach, Florida (CNN)A third person has been arrested in the case of an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of Panama City Beach, the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said Wednesday.

Police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. Tuesday.

"After developing information that George Davon Kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape, BCSO Investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest," according to a news release.

Investigators discovered that Kennedy had family in DeKalb County, Georgia, and reached out to the sheriff's office there. Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.

Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said.

Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said.

Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been "placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team."

Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf.

The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched.

The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities.

It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say.

Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for.

"There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on," McKeithen said. "And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County."

Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office.

Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week.

After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers.

She "does not remember the assault at all," Corley said. "She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged." (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.)

She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said.

The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office.

The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. "You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted."

The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said.

Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said.

The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released.

While the video is "one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach," it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said.

"This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered."

Corley said that through social media, "we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around."

About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year.

CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.

-----------------------------------------------
A BMW driver with five children on board was today arrested after a talented student was knocked down and killed as she walked to to the library.

Hina Shamim, 21,  died close to the University of Kingston in London last night, just weeks before her 22nd birthday.

Friends today left flowers at the scene and said Miss Shamim, who had the nickname Hyena and was originally from Peterborough, was 'much-loved and the most charming lovely girl in the world'.

Hina Shamim was killed after she was knocked down as she walked a short distance from home to the library

The BMW (left) was severely damaged in the crash, which also involved an empty bus (centre) 

Last night she was killed and eight others, including five children, were injured in a horror crash involving a bus and a car.

Witnesses said that the white BMW M3 sportscar knocked her down before careering head-on into a double decker bus.

The vehicle then span sideways and pinned Miss Shamim against a wall. 

Paramedics battled desperately to save the woman's life but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

It has been claimed the car was travelling at around 80mph.

Six people who were in the BMW, including five children between the ages of four and 16, were taken to hospital to be treated for injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening. 

One of the children is believed to have suffered a broken wrist and a four-year-old boy was said to need treatment for a head injury after the youngsters were showered with broken glass following the crash. 

Dozens of tributes have been left at the scene of the crash in Kingston, where Miss Shamim was killed 

The 34-year-old man driver was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remains in police custody today.

He was taken to hospital after the crash, along with his five passengers - two boys aged 16 and 12, two four-year-old boys, and an eight-year-old girl. 

The driver of the empty 418 bus, involved in the crash, was treated at the scene for minor injuries while an off-duty colleague, 39, who was with him was taken to hospital with leg injuries. 

Miss Shamim was completing her dissertation for a sports science course, and was due to complete her four years of studies this year. Friends claim she had been on her way to hand in coursework when she died.

The talented student was due to celebrate her 22nd birthday next week before she was knocked down 

Friends have described 21-year-old Miss Shamim as 'the loveliest person you could ever meet' 

Miss Shamim (right) was a popular student and was described as always having a smile on her face 

Monty Sajdewa, 24, who went to the gym with her, said: 'She was the most charming person you could ever meet. She was beautiful in every way.

'She lit up a room and was so caring and funny. She always had a smile on her face.'

A tribute poster left at the crash scene read: 'This dawn she's vanished, but shining in everyone that knew her, like the sun.'

Shabaz Shah, 20, a fellow student told the Evening Standard: 'She was the loveliest person you could ever meet. she loved life and was always in the gym or studying. She was the best person and we all loved her.' 

The talented student is believed to have been making a walk of just 50 metres from her flat to the library when she was knocked down. She was due to graduate next year.

The 21-year-old, originally from Peterborough, was due to celebrate her 22nd birthday in just a week

One of Miss Shamim's cousins, who did not want to be named, said: 'In our culture we don't really party so she always just put her head down and got on with her work. She had her whole life mapped out for her.

'She wanted to be a nutritionist and she was so passionate about that. She was always telling us what's good for us and what we shouldn't be eating.

'This isn't something we are going to get over easily. It's going to be in our hearts for a long time.'

Hina lived with her parents and two brothers in Peterborough before leaving for university. She came back to visit regularly.

London Ambulance Service declared a 'major incident' following the collision at around 9pm on Tuesday night and around 15 ambulances and police cars were called to the scene. The incident took place just 100 yards from the entrance to the university's Penrhyn Road campus.

Witnesses described hearing a 'loud bang' at the time of the crash.

One who saw the aftermath said: 'We just walked out to take the dog for a walk as it had just happened and the police were arriving.

'There was a man who ran off with a small child, and then he came back screaming at the police to help his other child.

'The whole of the car's front end up to the window is in pieces.'

A 39-year-old male passenger on the bus, as well as the bus driver, were also treated for minor injuries.

Detective Sergeant John Hartfree from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit at the Met Police said: 'Penrhyn Road would have been busy at the time of the collision and I am appealing for anyone who saw this tragic event unfold to contact police.

'I am particularly keen to speak to the occupants of a dark coloured car which was seen following the white BMW M3 car immediately prior to the collision.'

The convertible car was seen smashed and sprawled across a pavement and the front garden of a home after the crash last night.

The victim's next of kin has been informed while formal identification is under way.

Liverpool are showing interest in Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile.

The Italy international has not had the best of times in the Bundesliga following his move from Torino last summer and Dortmund are willing to sell.

Immobile fits the profile of player Liverpool want. He has pace and is a busy forward who can chase down the opposition. His goals ratio has dropped at Dortmund but he has still managed nine goals in a troubled season for the team.

Liverpool have made contact with Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc to sound out the figures.

Dortmund are expecting further departures with Manchester United keen on Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gundogan while Real Madrid have expressed interest once again in Marco Reus.

Liverpool are also continuing to check on Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia but their lack of Champions League football could prove crucial in their pursuit of certain players as well as their budget. 

Arsenal have also considered reviving interest in France international Kondogbia. Arsene Wenger enquired after the 22-year-old while he was at Sevilla.

Spartak Moscow want to rescue Nemanja Vidic from his nightmare spell at Inter Milan.

The former Manchester United captain, now 33, has failed to settle under Roberto Mancini and has been criticised for some of his performances. 

Spartak have reportedly offered a one year deal worth around £35,000 a week but Vidic wants two years if he leaves Italy. Vidic played for Spartak between 2004 and 2006. 

Nemanja Vidic (right) has struggled since moving to Italy with Inter Milan and is attracting interest in Russia

Tottenham sent a scout to watch Lille against Bordeaux last weekend where Lille won 2-0 and midfielders Sofiane Boufal and Idrissa Gueye impressed.

Tottenham were also represented last week as Club Brugge played out a 0-0 draw with Dnipro in the Europa League. 

Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka was understood to be the object of Tottenham's attentions with Chelsea and West Ham also represented at the game.

Chelsea have checked on Standard Liege left-back Damien Dussaut. 

The 20-year-old Frenchman has only started five games in the Belgian league this season but is seen as a bright prospect. 

Paris Saint Germain remain keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with Liverpool looking unlikely to match the financial package required to prise him out of Stamford Bridge. PSG also like Tottenham's Hugo Lloris but Daniel Levy is no mood to sell the France goalkeeper.

Manchester City are considering the merits of QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy.

The 25-year-old has had to take a back seat this season while in-form Robert Green held down the No 1 spot.

However, the England U21 international is still recognised as one of the more talented English keepers in the country and has been the subject of interest from Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton over the past year. 

Alex McCarthy (centre) has played second fiddle to Rob Green at QPR but could be a target for Man City

He joined QPR from Reading at the end of last August despite Brendan Rodgers making an attempt to take him to Anfield.

City need to address their shortage of homegrown players and McCarthy could fit in.

Feyenoord, meanwhile, are struggling to finance a transfer for City striker John Guidetti who has been on loan at Celtic.

Stoke City are keen on Blackpool teenager Dom Telford.

The 18-year-old striker managed to break into the Blackpool first team this season scoring on his home debut against Rotherham in December.

Dom Telford (right) of Blackpool has attracted interest from Stoke, who made a bid for the player in January

City manager Mark Hughes made an approach in January which was rejected but has continually sent scouts to monitor his progress and Telford could reject a contract at Bloomfield Road to switch to the Britannia.

Hughes is keen to add more quality young players and has already moved for Barcelona's Moha El Mouriachi, 19, and Thibaud Verlinden, 15, of Standard Liege.

Blackpool's Mark Waddington, 18, remains a target for Brighton. 

Fulham and QPR are showing interest in Celtic defender Efe Ambrose.

Both London clubs are looking to re-shape their squads in the summer and Ambrose would still fit into their wage structure.

The 26-year-old Nigeria international who has 46 caps is ready to leave Celtic and has interest from Premier League sides also but is keen on a move to London. 

QPR will lose Steven Caulker, Rio Ferdinand, possibly Richard Dunne and expect Nedum Onouha to move on also.

Celtic defender Efe Ambrose is ready to leave the club and is wanted by London rivals Fulham and QPR 

West Ham have revived interest in Pedro Obiang of Sampdoria as they consider midfield targets.

As reported by Sportsmail, West Ham have doubts about a permanent deal for Alex Song with Inter Milan also showing an interest. 

Roberto Mancini has Song and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool on his back-up list should he fail to sign Yaya Toure from Manchester City.

West Ham want more energy in midfield and have considered James McArthur of Crystal Palace but Obiang remains on their radar too.

Spanish-born Obiang is a Spain U21 international and began his career with Atletico Madrid. West Ham showed interest last summer and in January. Sampdoria want £8million for the 23-year-old but West Ham may strike a deal for £5m plus add-ons.

Radja Nainggolan (left) has been put up for sale by Roma but the Italian club want £29m for the midfielder

Roma have put Belgium international Radja Nainggolan up for sale but want £29million.

The 26-year-old is an all-round midfielder and can play the anchor role. Liverpool, Manchester United and City have all been encouraged to make offers as Roma and co-owners Cagliari look to cut their losses and balance the books ahead of other deals this summer. 

However, all three have other priorities at this stage.

Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved.

But Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows.

The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth.

Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat.

However, despite his best efforts, the egg narrowly misses his jaw, bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead.

A defeated Fritz is then seen hanging his head low, with his bunny ears falling to the ground.

The pup has made quite a name for himself with his poor catching skills. Indeed, his YouTube channel boasts more than five million hits.

Other videos show him being thrown steak, tacos, bread rolls, pizza and donuts, with misses every time. 

Fritz's owner, Evan Ball, hopes that one day the dog will be able to achieve the 'paw-fect' catch.

He added: 'While we all intently anticipate the day when Fritz masters the skill of catching food in his mouth, we also patiently embrace the journey.'

Fire crews in South Wales say they have been stretched to breaking point . 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland in one month . Emergency services took more than 1,600 calls for grass fires from Friday to Monday . Cost of fighting the blazes has risen close to # 500,000 since the month began .

A boy of 11 is among children arrested over a spate of fires across Welsh countryside which have cost £500,000 to fight.

Five children were questioned by police after 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland this month alone.

Fire crews in South Wales say they have been stretched to breaking point by the ‘unprecedented’ scale of destruction, which is mainly being blamed on gangs of youngsters.

Five children have been questioned after 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland in one month

Officers yesterday called on parents to report their children if they suspect them of lighting fires.

Deputy Chief Constable Matt Jukes, of South Wales Police, said: ‘It is only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously injured or even killed.

‘What is most concerning is that we believe that many of these grass fires are being caused by children. This must be addressed and everybody can do their bit.’

‘Teachers, neighbours, shop owners, but most importantly parents or carers have a role to play and can make a stand against this recurring problem.’

DCC Jukes added: ‘The sad reality is that because of the naïve and reckless actions of some of the youngest members of the community, the lives of those who need the emergency services most are being put at serious risk.’ 

From Friday morning to Monday evening, emergency services took more than 1,600 calls for grass fires.

Gordon Shumack, of Crimestoppers Wales, said: ‘The valleys are turning black again as a result of these fires being deliberately started.’

The cost of fighting the blazes, which devastated wildlife, has risen close to £500,000 since the month began.

Fire chief Stephen Rossiter said: ‘The natural terrain of mountains is very dangerous underfoot, and more so when we are fighting grass fires – even for our best-trained people.’

South Wales: Gordon Shumack said the valleys were turning black as a result of the deliberately started fires

‘It is quite possible a house will catch fire if the incidents continue. People lighting them need to understand the danger they can cause.’

The arrested 11-year-old was given ‘stern’ advice by police. Four suspects aged 12 to 14 were released on bail.

It comes as the dry and sunny weather has left heathlands especially vulnerable to fast spreading fire. 

Meanwhile a blaze which ravaged the Pirbright Army ranges in Surrey was yesterday still smouldering nearly a week after it began.

Conservation experts say that the area could take ten years to recover. A man, 33, has been arrested and released on bail over the fire.

She spent some of the money on shopping sprees in JD Sports and B&Q . The money was also used to pay for photography services and an XBox .

-----------------------------------------------
A mother-of-two has been jailed after stealing almost £80,000 from her dying parents to go on shopping sprees - leaving her elderly father in debt and too poor to afford a telephone.

Christine Lillico, 47, from  Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, was trusted with looking after her elderly parents' bank accounts as their health deteriorated with age.

But instead of using the money to care for John and Audrey Air she plundered their life savings to bankroll her own lifestyle.

Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard mother-of-two Christine Lillico, 47 was supposed to look after her elderly parents' bank accounts - but instead stole almost £80,000 from them over a six year period

By the time her fraud was discovered Lillico had stolen a total of £78,000.

Newcastle Crown Court heard in the last months of his life Mr Air went without a telephone and basic amenities, while suffering the shame of being in debt for the first time in his life because of his daughter's crimes.

A judge has now sent Lillico to jail and ordered she pay her brother John Air junior £39,000 - which would have been his inheritance has she not stolen it.

Sentencing her to 20 months behind bars, Mr Recorder Baird said: 'You were trusted by your parents to look after them in their elderly years. 

'They had modest savings which had taken all their lives to accumulate through hard work.

'Over a period of six years you plundered those savings. 

'The result of that was when your father died in 2014 he was in debt, something he had never been in before and that is something that caused him great distress.'

The court heard Lillico spent some of the £78,000 on shopping sprees in B&Q (file image)

Christopher Knox, prosecuting, explained how Mr and Mrs Air, from Ashington, had both worked in the coal industry and had pensions.

The couple gave their daughter control of their bank accounts after they sold their home for £95,000 and moved in to a sheltered flat, as their health began to fail as they grew older.

'The couple lived very sensibly,' said Mr Knox. 'By 2008 there was at least £55,000 in a savings account.'

The court heard Mrs Air, who had suffered from dementia, passed away in October 2010 and Mr Air died in July 2014.

But the court heard Lillico had been raiding her parents' accounts since 2008.

Debit card transactions were made at various shops including JD Sports and B&Q. 

The accounts had also been used to pay for photography services and to buy an XBox and cash was also withdrawn from the banks and cheques written.

The court heard Lillico is of previous good character. She pleaded guilty to three charges of fraud.

It was calculated the amount of money Lillico stole amounted to what she and her brother would have inherited between them.

The judge made an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act that she repay the half she owes within six months.

Nigel Hedley, defending, said Lillico was hit by financial problems after a difficult divorce.

'She was a woman of good character. She had a very traumatic divorce and encountered severe financial difficulties.'

He also said Lillico had been suspended from her job as a medical secretary as a result of her crimes, but that she would be able to pay her brother the money she owed by re-mortgaging her house.

Police have dramatically arrested a 27-year-old man who tried to flee the area after officers found a woman’s body in the boot of the car he was driving.

The man ran into bushland after police stopped a blue Hyundai Getz car on the Bermagui to Tathra Road in the Bega Valley, on the far south coast of NSW, just after 8.30pm on Wednesday.

But on Thursday evening 7 News captured the moment when he was finally arrested by police. Officers were shown chasing the man into bushland and over a fence before pouncing on him.

'Show me your hands!' the arresting police officer screamed at the man. The man did as he was told and gave himself up without a struggle. He was then taken away in a police van.

Detective Superintendent Peter O’Brien said he could not yet release the name of the victim.

However, it has been confirmed police are investigating whether the body is that of missing Canberra woman Daniella D’Addario, 35. 

Ms D’Addario was reported missing by concerned family members on Monday after disappearing along with her boyfriend Josaia (Joey) Vosikata, 27.

Detective Acting Sergeant Jason Taylor previously described her car saying: ‘They may have been travelling in Daniella’s car which was a silver or light blue Hyundai Getz.’ 

Her vehicle’s ACT registration is YEF19M. 

Ms D’Addario was a teacher at Canberra High School in 2009 and her former students have begun commenting about her disappearance on Facebook.

One wrote: 'This is too sad.' Another added: 'I saw her at kmart not long ago.'

Police have not yet identified the woman's body but are investigating whether it could missing Canberra woman Daniella D’Addario

On Thursday morning NSW Police confirmed: ‘A crime scene has been established at the car, and a perimeter has been set up as police search for the man.  

‘Investigations into the incident are continuing. Initial investigations suggest the man and woman were known to each other.’

Police said they are hoping to speak with a man who may be able to assist with inquiries.

He is described as being of Pacific Islander/Maori appearance, in his late 20s, with an athletic build. He was last seen wearing dark clothing.

‘Police advise members of the public who see the man or know his whereabouts not to approach him, but to contact Triple 0 immediately,’ a statement said.

Daley Blind has hailed a pre-match team talk from skipper Wayne Rooney about ending their run of four successive losses against City with giving the United players an extra edge on Sunday.

'It was a thing what was always in our minds. It was going through the team. Everyone knew how important this game was, not only because it's a rat race in the last games, but also because of the history of the last four games,' he said.

'Wayne Rooney mentioned that in the dressing room before the game to all the players and it is something that you have in mind when you go on to the pitch. You saw how everyone was fighting for each other.

'Maybe after the first five minutes we were a bit like, 'What is happening here?' but after that we picked it up again and we did very well. And with the crowd behind us, it was amazing.'

The Holland international also warned that Manchester United need to focus on the end of this season rather than thinking about challenging for the title next year.

The 25-year-old Dutchman, who has played a significant role in United's run of six consecutive wins, accepted rivals would have taken note of the 4-2 derby win.

He insisted, however, that although United could win the title next year, they had to focus on securing a Champions League place - starting against Chelsea on Saturday.

'Of course other teams are watching us, but we have to watch ourselves this season, our own games, focus on that and then we will see where it ends

'We don't have to watch for Chelsea. We have to watch for our own games, we have to look at ourselves. Every game is a final to the end and we have to believe in ourselves.'

-----------------------------------------------
A teenage Welsh international has had her promising career halted by a dead shin bone.

Hannah Bluck, 18, from Porthcawl, south Wales, had her dreams shattered after a rare condition ruled her out of the game for two years.

The teen football prodigy was warned by doctors that her leg could collapse into her ankle after being diagnosed with avascular necrosis in her distal tibia.

Wales' Hannah Bluck, 18,  has had her promising career halted after suffering a rare condition

The 18-year-old has played for the Wales youth national teams at U19, U17 and U16 level

Avascular necrosis is bone death due to poor blood supply.

The flow of blood to a section of bone can be interrupted if the bone is fractured or the joint becomes dislocated.

The condition can lead to the eventual collapse of the bone.

It is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 60, though most suffer from it in the hip and shoulder.

The ultra-rare condition has caused her weight-bearing shin bone to die from lack of oxygen.

Doctors have been baffled by the condition, which has never been seen before on a leg bone and usually affects joints.

Mum Kerstin said: 'The doctor told her "Hannah, you have to listen to everything I say because even if you go jogging then your leg could collapse into your ankle and that would be the worst thing that could ever happen".

'I think she's dealt with it better than we have as parents. She's been so brave.

'She has such a high pain threshold and her first words to me after her accident were "where've you been and what took you so long?"

'Hannah's a girl of few words but one of the most aggressive centre-backs you'll ever see.'

The youngster set records at youth level for Wales - appearing for the under-16s, under-17s and under-19s sides in the space of just eight days - before she was struck down by a freak accident in March 2013.

The promising centre-back suffered a sickening dislocation of her ankle and fractured her fibia and tibia after falling while running on astroturf during routine training.

Despite the help of Football Association of Wales and Cardiff City physios, the talented star hit a brick road in her recovery and saw specialists in November 2013 when she discovered she had AVN.

Hannah, who is also autistic, has not kicked a ball since and turned her hand to coaching, working with the girls' Under-8s, 10s and 14s at Swansea.

Kerstin said: 'Hannah has always had a ball at her feet and played for her first club when she was seven.

'She used to play with the boys until she was 11 and she wasn't happy when she had to stop - she enjoys the rough and tumble.'

'Football is everything for her and she has missed out on the social side because all her friends are at football so she doesn't see them.

'She's had her bad days but we're getting more positive ones now.'

Despite two years on the sidelines, Hannah is still dreaming of a senior appearance for the Wales national side and is being followed by Women's Super League side Bristol Academy.

Manchester United supporter Hannah said: 'It would mean everything to get back out on the pitch after two years out - when I play that is when I am most happy in life.

'It's so frustrating having to sit and watch when I just want to be out there playing.

'It's my dream to get a full senior Wales cap and I'd love to go and be a professional player in America too.'

The treatment Hannah had been receiving was discovered to have stopped working last month leaving the family with nowhere to turn.

In desperation, mum-of-five Kerstin took to Facebook and was amazed when a school friend she had not spoke to for almost three decades got in touch.

The long-lost contact threw the family a lifeline as experts at the world's biggest orthopaedic conference in Las Vegas in the USA ended up analysing Hannah's MRI scan.

As a result, Hannah, who lives with brothers Daniel, 23, Thomas, 20, Conor, 16, Ben, 10, and dad Jonathan, 42, as well as Kerstin, has secured an appointment with a leading specialist in London on April 20.

Kerstin said: 'She is still training all the time at Swansea City and you should see her upper body now.

'She has a core that puts some of the men to shame when she is in the gym with all of them.

'Hannah's so humble but she can do so many things that even the men there would struggle to do.

'It's been a hard two years for her but she has never given up and she never will do.

'I'm proud of every single breath that girl takes.'

A pitcher with the Colorado Rockies is taking some time out from the sport to care for his young son, who was bitten by a rattlesnake last month in Arizona.

Right-handed reliever John Axford was placed on the family medical emergency list before the Rockies game on Sunday.

His son had surgery last Monday - opening day for the Rockies - on his right foot to remove necrotic tissue.

Axford said the toes of 2-year-old Jameson 'look fine,' but doctors are trying to improve mobility as they combat infection.

Jameson will board an emergency medical flight on Monday to Denver for more treatment.

'We still have a long road, a long process to go,' Axford said. 'But at least I'll be able to be closer to him.'

His son was bitten twice in the yard of the house his family rented in Scottsdale for spring training.

The family was hoping for 'better things' after the surgery.

'The necrotic tissue on his foot ended up being worse than we thought,' explained Axford, who also has a 3-year-old son, JB.

'There was a lot of infection in there and it was a staph infection. The tissue they thought was going to be good turned out to not be great. … His foot is in pretty rough shape in spots.'

More surgery will be necessary, and Axford said one of the top surgeons is in Denver.

The Axford family will board an emergency medical flight on Monday to Denver so that Jameson, center, can have more treatment

'The doctors in Arizona have been amazing. They've texted me, called me, keeping me updated with everything,' Axford said.

'They told me they all agreed that this was the worst rattlesnake bite they'd seen in the area. It's pretty unfortunate that it went that way for him, but it was fortunate that it was in the area that it was, on his foot, not somewhere else on his body, especially with the damage that was done.'

Axford will be out for at least three days and a maximum of a week.

Axford has made one appearance for the Rockies this season, getting a save with a scoreless 10th inning on Wednesday at Milwaukee. But really his mind has been anywhere but the ballpark.

His wife, Nicole, has been constantly by his son's side at the hospital.

Given Jameson's age, Axford is hoping his son won't remember too much about this incident.

'Hopefully because he is 2 he'll be able to erase it from his memory. But he'll have an incredible scar on his foot to show people and he'll have the story from us,' Axford said.

Axford, who has been given sick leave for at least three days and a maximum of a week, tweeted his thanks last month for the support his family had received after Jameson, 2, was bitten twice by a rattlesnake

Rockies manager Walt Weiss went through a health scare with his son more than a decade ago and shared his story with Axford.

When Weiss was playing for Atlanta in 1998, his son, Brody, got E. coli and developed a blood disease. Brody Weiss was in critical condition for a few weeks. Now Brody is playing baseball at a community college.

'Dealt with a life-and-death situation with my son and was away from the team for a while, and so I was certainly able to empathize with him, in sharing that story,' Walt Weiss said.

'That doesn't make it any easier for John, but I think it helps when someone can share a similar experience with you.'

To take Axford's spot, the Rockies selected the contract of righty Scott Oberg from Triple-A Albuquerque. They also transferred infielder Charlie Culberson (back) to the 60-day disabled list.

A father has been left furious after police ran over his daughter’s cat – and then simply told the family that their pet had been ‘disposed of’.

Harry the ginger tom was hit by a police car near Tony Hunt’s home. But instead of tracking down the owner and explaining what had happened, the officers involved knocked on a neighbour’s door and asked for a black bin bag.

A witness then described seeing them ‘scooping Harry up and placing him in the bag in the boot of the car’.

Tony Hunt, from Normanton in Derby, is demanding an apology from police after a neighbour reported his daughter's cat Harry had been hit by a patrol car and 'disposed of'

Mr Hunt spent two days putting up ‘lost cat’ posters in his area before finding out what had happened from a local teenager. Incredibly, when he contacted police, officers coldly told him Harry had been ‘disposed of’.

Yesterday Mr Hunt, from Normanton, Derby, broke down as he described how a neighbour had witnessed the police car running over his cat.

The incident is now being investigated by Derbyshire Police’s Professional Standards Department, he said.

Mr Hunt, 42, said he had told five-year-old daughter Lily that her beloved pet had gone to heaven, but could not bring himself to tell her why.

He accused police of a ‘lack of humanity’ and demanded a face-to-face apology from the two officers involved – one of whom was a WPC.

Mr Hunt is outraged as the three-year-old ginger cat (pictured) was micro-chipped so officers could easily have contacted the family

The restaurant manager, who lives with partner Zoe Price, 30, their daughter Lily and one-year-old son Thomas, said: ‘What has happened is absolutely disgusting.

‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing when a young lad called to tell me he had seen the police run over Harry.

‘I called 101 straight away and eventually spoke to a desk sergeant, who confirmed Harry had been hit and said he’d been “disposed of”.

‘There was no compassion whatsoever. He didn’t go into details as to how Harry had been “disposed of” and I didn’t want to know, to be honest. For all I know, they could have tossed him straight in the bin.’

Mr Hunt was informed about the three-year-old cat’s demise by Ali Nisar, who lives a street away. The 16-year-old saw the car coming ‘at speed’ down the road with its blue lights flashing last Sunday.

Mr Hunt'sfamily have been devastated by what happened, saying a 'huge chunk' of their lives is now missing

He said: ‘The cat was in the middle of the road but the car went straight over it. They didn’t seem to brake, but I don’t know how they could not have seen it.’

Mr Nisar added: ‘Two days later I saw Tony’s poster and recognised the picture of the cat. I rang him to tell him that the police had killed his cat. I was gobsmacked that they hadn’t already informed him.’

Mr Hunt said Harry was microchipped and his body could have been returned to the family for cremation if the police had taken him to a vet or the RSPCA to be scanned. He added: ‘If it hadn’t been for my neighbour witnessing what happened, we’d still be searching for him now.’

A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said it was ‘aware of the allegations’, adding: ‘We’re in the process of trying to identify the officers who are allegedly involved to get their account of what happened.’

Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan – stoking fears of a buy-to-let boom.

The offer comes as pension reforms give over-55s access to billions of pounds from today to withdraw from their pension pots and spend as they like.

Tens of thousands of savers are being tempted to put their money into property – and this surge of ‘silver landlords’ is likely to push up house prices.

Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan, meaning some pensioners are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105 (file picture, posed)

Traditionally, banks have been reluctant to allow borrowing beyond retirement, but now other lenders are considering raising their age limits too.

Savers who want to put their money towards buy-to-let properties are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase a house outright, with the average price standing at £273,000.

The option of taking out a mortgage to cover the shortfall has previously been unavailable as banks prefer people to repay before turning 70 or 75.

But unlike residential mortgages, funded by income likely to fall away in retirement, a buy-to-let mortgage is funded by rental income, which does not cease when the owner retires.

Economists say the increase in silver landlords competing to buy properties is boosting house prices, which are increasing at 8.4 per cent a year.

Three in four of Britain’s 2million landlords regard their property as their pension, according to research from financial consultancy BDRC.

About one in five homes in Britain are owned by private landlords, and this is expected to rise to one in three by 2032, Government figures suggest.

But there are perils too. The buy-to-let boom expected to follow today’s changes could have painful tax consequences for some, experts warn.

Withdrawing large sums from a pension pot will trigger a hefty income tax bill – for example, taking out £150,000 will produce a £40,000 demand from HMRC.

Buy-to-let homes also attract tax on rental income and capital gains tax if the property is later sold. And for ageing landlords, there is inheritance tax to consider too.

Tens of thousands of savers who have had their pension released under today's new reforms are being tempted to put their money into property – and this surge of ‘silver landlords’ is likely to push up house prices

Jane Vass of Age UK said: ‘Although Age UK believes affordability not age should determine whether someone is given a loan, using your pension fund to pay the deposit could have significant tax and financial consequences and if there is a downturn in the rental market you could find your own financial security is jeopardised.’

Nationwide decided soon after the pension reforms were announced in 2014 that it would consider applicants aged up to 70 for a 35-year loan. 

The firm said it had recognised that buy-to-let was becoming a more popular source of retirement income as reports suggest half a million savers could plough pension pots into buy-to-let properties after the reforms take effect today.

Experts have also warned of the difficulty of taking on a landlords’ responsibilities. Financial strategist Penny O’Nions said: ‘A lot of people will buy houses with their pension funds with no idea of the repercussions.

‘There may be excellent advantages but the downsides are that many of them will not appreciate that the management of a property can be harsh. When you are aged 104, do you really want to be managing a property?

‘Difficult tenants feigning problems with the property, periods when the property is empty, council tenants not paying – there is a long list. People should not go into it without good advice.’

If a person with a mortgage that lasts until they are 105 dies before paying off the loan, the usual rules apply: their estate, or whoever inherits the property, would either take on the debt or the house would be sold to pay off the mortgage. However, it is cheaper for young people to obtain life cover to pay off the mortgage if they die early.

Paul Smith takes on Andre Ward in Oakland on June 20 . The fight will not be for Ward 's WBA super-middleweight world title . Ward has not boxed since November 2013 . Smith failed in back-to-back challenges for Arthur Abraham 's beltBO belt . CLICK HERE for all the latest boxing news .
-----------------------------------------------
Paul Smith has landed one of the toughest fights in boxing after finalising terms to face Andre Ward on June 20.

As revealed by Sportsmail, the fight in Oakland, California will not be for Ward's WBA super-middleweight world title.

But it amounts to a huge, albeit daunting, opportunity for Smith, who failed in back-to-back challenges for Arthur Abraham's WBO belt.

Ward (right) has not fought since he beat Edwin Rodriguez on points in November 2013

In Ward he will face a man who outclassed Carl Froch in 2011, but who has been inactive since November 2013. Ring rust from that 17-month spell could be a factor in determining if Smith can beat one of the sport's top pound-for-pound talents, with the 32-year-old saying: 'I cannot wait to get back in the ring and test myself against a class act like Andre Ward.

'I proved that I belong at the top level with my performances against Arthur Abraham and this is a challenge that I am relishing. Andre is a top pound-for-pound fighter and someone I respect a lot, but he has only boxed once in almost three years and I will give it everything I have got.

'I am fresh and confident going into this fight. It's a massive opportunity for me and one that I took with both hands when it was offered. I have spent a lot of time boxing in the United States and I look forward to returning for this fight.'

Ward said: 'I'm very excited to be coming back on June 20 at Oracle Arena in my hometown of Oakland, which has been a long time coming. I have an extremely tough fighter in front of me in Paul Smith, who's looking to pull the upset, but I can't let that happen.

'I have to be on my best game to turn Smith away and beat him the way I want to beat him.' 

Ward's WBA world super-middleweight title will not be on the line when he faces Smith in June

A two-year-old girl in southern California was found naked sitting by herself in a parking lot two hours after disappearing from her mother at a car wash.

The Gardena toddler reportedly shouted 'mommy' before her mother turned around and could not find her daughter around 4.55 pm on Thursday.

Her girl, who has not been identified, was found injured outside of Jim's Burgers 13 miles away and was spotted by concerned customers next to a dumpster.

A two-year-old girl from Gardena, California, was found Thursday night after disappearing from a car wash and shouting 'mommy'

Police are searching for the driver of a white recent-model Nissan Altima, which was seen at the car wash around the time the girl was abducted

Claudia Robles, who was heading into the burger joint around 7.15pm, said that the little girl had scratches on her legs and was afraid of going toward the male police officers.

The little girl, whom Gardena police have asked not to be identified, repeatedly covered her eyes and screamed after she was found.

Police, who originally said she was OK, would not describe the extent of her injuries, according to KTLA. 

The girl's mother was too distressed to speak to media.

'She's a pure little innocent baby,' her aunt Grecian Alvarez said. 

The young girl was discovered sitting alone in the parking lot of a burger restaurant 13 miles away and was scared by male police officers

Police would not describe the extent of the young girl's injuries. Above, the white Nissan was also seen driving in a Gardena neighborhood 

Her abductor is believed to be a stranger to the two-year-old. 

Authorities are looking for the driver of a white, recent-model Nissan Altima captured on video at the car wash the same time the girl was abducted.

The driver, who had tinted windows, is believed to be a serial predator.

Caesar Alvarez, the girl's uncle, said that she was doing well on Friday.

She was taken to St Francis Medical Center for examination.

-----------------------------------------------
A newborn baby girl abandoned in an amusement arcade was found face down in a toilet bowl after her 'mother gave birth in the lavatory', it has been revealed.

It is believed the girl, named April by staff at the Ormskirk hospital where she is being treated, might have been delivered at Silcock's Amusement Arcade in Nevill Street, Southport, hours before she was discovered.

Merseyside Police had released an image of the 6lb 9oz baby girl, wearing a pink playsuit, as they sought to identify her mother.

In a statement yesterday afternoon, officers said they had traced the mother to an address in the Merseyside area.

Officers say they have found the mother of baby April (pictured). Sniffer dogs had been deployed in the area after the discovery in the disabled toilets of an arcade

Police earlier released a CCTV image of a woman they were looking to trace after a newborn baby was found at Silcock’s Amusement Arcade, on Neville Street, Southport last night

Amusement arcade employee Christina Hodskinson found baby April when a colleague said the toilets needed cleaning. She was quickly joined by fellow worker Warren Chadwick who came to help

Police believe April may have been 'born where she was found', Sky reported today. She was just hours old when she was discovered. 

Staff at the amusement arcade earlier spoke of the moment the baby was whisked from the toilet bowl when a father's paternal instincts kicked in. 

Christina Hodskinson, 44, discovered the newborn, who has since been named baby April by hospital staff, after a colleague said the toilets needed cleaning. 

She was quickly joined by fellow employee Warren Chadwick, 36, who Ms Hodskinson said 'grabbed the baby out of the toilet'. 

Mr Chadwick, who works at Silcock’s Amusement Arcade, on Neville Street, Southport where the baby was found at around 6.50pm yesterday, told how his paternal instinct kicked in immediately.

He said: 'I saw the baby and it was just instant, I grabbed her out and patted her back and she started to cry.

'Some customers got some towels and we wrapped her up and stood under the heaters.

'The police got here really quickly, I sat with her in the police car to keep her warm and then we rushed straight to hospital.

Paternal instinct: Warren Chadwick, who works at Silcock’s Amusement Arcade, told how April let out a cry when he patted her back after pulling her from the toilet. He said his paternal instinct kicked in immediately

'She was ice cold when I pulled her out so they kept her in an incubator.

'It was just good to see the colour come back in her face, it was a relief.'

The infant was taken to Ormskirk Hospital where she is described as 'safe and well'.

Police were searching for the missing mother of baby April and released a CCTV image of a woman they were looking to trace earlier today. The mother has now been found, Merseyside Police have said.

A spokesman said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm the mother of a newborn found in Southport on Thursday, 16 April has this afternoon been found.

'She was found within the Merseyside area and is currently receiving medical treatment.

Superintendent Claire Richards, said: 'I would like to thank the local community, the online community and the media for their assistance in this matter.' 

Ms Hodskinson spoke of how she found the baby after walking into the arcade's disabled toilets to give them a clean.

The baby girl, found in the disabled toilets at the arcade (pictured) on Neville Street, has been named April by staff caring for her at Ormskirk Hospital. April is said to be 'safe and well'

She said: 'I noticed that there were some things out of place. We checked the bin and there was nothing there and I just thought something wasn't right.

'So I went back to the bathroom with another member of staff, Pauline.

'She opened the toilet and starting screaming "there's a baby inside!" 'My colleague Warren was there straightaway and he grabbed the baby out of the toilet.'

Police said the birth appeared to have been unsupervised.

Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists Manchester City can come from behind again to snatch the Barclays Premier League title from Chelsea.

City overtook Liverpool with one match to go before being crowned champions last season and in 2012, Sergio Aguero's injury-time strike in the final game sank Manchester United on goal difference.

Chelsea are currently six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but Pardew, whose Palace side host City on Monday, believes the race is far from over.

'Of course they are still in the title race, it's been proven many times the race is never over,' Pardew said. 'Even when City won it, it went to the last seconds.

'It's the great thing about the Premier League, you can't take victories for granted.'

Pardew has no fresh injury concerns ahead of the match against City.

Marouane Chamakh, Fraizer Campbell (both hamstring) and Jordon Mutch (thigh) are still out while captain Mile Jedinak is suspended.

-----------------------------------------------
Rescuers were forced to abandon their efforts to save 149 dolphins that were stranded on a beach in Japan after working tirelessly all day to help the creatures.

As darkness fell on the beach in Hokota, around 60 miles northeast of Tokyo, coastguards and officials called off the rescue operation after only managing to save three of the 149 melon-headed dolphins that had beached.

The rest of the animals had either died or were dying, they said.

Rescuers managed to save three dolphins, but the remaining of the beached pod are 'dead or dying'

Workers use a crane to remove one of the 146 melon-headed whales that died when beached in Hokota

'It was becoming dark and too dangerous to continue the rescue work at this beach, where we could not bring heavy equipment,' a Hokota city official said.

'Many people volunteered to rescue them but the dolphins became very, very weak.'

'Only three of them have been successfully returned to the sea, as far as we can confirm,' he added.

Volunteers from local communities had joined forces with coastguards to try and save the dolphins, pouring water on them to stop their skins drying out.

They also used slings to carry some back into the water, after they were seen early on Friday morning on the beach writhing in pain.

But despite desperate efforts to help the melon-headed whales, some  were being pushed back onto the beach by the tide soon after being released.

The creatures are usually found deep in the sea but have mysteriously beached about 60 miles northeast of Tokyo.

The location of Hokota where the dolphins beached. It is now thought 150 creatures are on the beach in Japan

Television footage showed several animals had been badly cut, and many had deep gashes on their skin.

Speaking earlier today a coastguard official said they are aware a number of the sea creatures have died.

'We see one or two whales washing ashore a year, but this may be the first time we have found over 100 of them on a beach,. he added.

A Hokota city official said they had counted 149 dolphins, revising an earlier figure of 130. Three had been successfully returned to the sea by the late afternoon, he added.

Coastguards covered the dolphins in blankets and put them on a boat so they could be put back in the sea

The Japanese Coast Guard worked nonestop to save the melon-headed whales, part of the dolpin family

The creatures usually live in the deep ocean, but for an unexplained reason had become beached on the shore

Dozens of volunteers and local residents turned out to help coastguards with the dolphin rescue operation

The pod of dolphins was stretched out along a roughly six mile-long stretch of beach in Hokota, Ibaraki, where they were found by locals early on Friday morning.

While the reason for the beaching was unclear, Tadasu Yamadao, a researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said the dolphins might have got lost.

He explained: 'Sonar waves the dolphins emit might have been absorbed in the shoals, which could cause them to lose their sense of direction.'

Melon-headed whales, also known as electra dolphins, are relatively common in Japanese waters and can grow to be two-to-three meters (six-to-nine feet) long.

Dolphins emit sonar waves, but researches say if these are absorbed they can lose their sense of direction

The rescue operation is in stark contract with Japan's stereotypical attitude towards whales, which are hunted

In 2011, about 50 melon-headed whales beached themselves in a similar area.

The dolphin rescue that took place on Friday was a stark contract to the Japan's reputation towards its sealife, as the country continues to hunt minke and pilot whales despite international criticism.

It has never made any secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed.

Japan also defies international opinion with the annual slaughter of hundreds of dolphins in a bay near the southern whaling town of Taiji.

The killing was brought to worldwide attention with the Oscar-winning documentary 'The Cove'.

Elsewhere, Espanyol extended Villarreal's winless streak to six games in all competitions as two goals from Felipe Caicedo handed the Catalans a 3-0 win at El Madrigal.

Caicedo had a slice of fortune in opening the scoring as Javi Lopez's miscued header deflected off the Ecuadorian and he then thumped home his second of the evening after the break at Sergio Asenjo's near post.

Asenjo had a night to forget as he also spilled Sergio Garcia's cross 11 minutes from time to allow Victor Sanchez to roll the ball into an empty net to complete Villarreal's misery.

-----------------------------------------------
Any defender who saw Jack Grealish glide around the Wembley turf with composure beyond his years should think twice before deciding that kicking him off the pitch is the way to limit his effectiveness.

Between the ages of 10 and 14, Grealish played Gaelic football to a high standard, even appearing at Croke Park five years ago in a match during half-time of a Dublin v Kerry senior game.

On his debut for John Mitchels, a GAA club in Warwickshire, he received a mighty blow and appealed to the referee. ‘This isn’t soccer, Jack,’ he was told without pity.

After progressing through the Villa youth ranks he had to give up the sport where opponents would kick him and stamp on his fingers, but the toughness remains.

The 19-year-old was clobbered by two fouls against Liverpool in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final win, picking himself up each time. He wears his socks rolled down to show he is unafraid of taking ferocious hits. 

As a 15-year-old he watched a Sky Sports special dedicated to George Best and saw the Manchester United great dribble through a forest of tackles to score. Best wore his socks round his ankles in defiance, and Grealish decided to do the same.

Now there is an aspect of superstition to the practice although he does buy kid-sized shinpads to meet safety regulations.

‘It’s just his style,’ said Villa manager Tim Sherwood. ‘If he performs how I think he can, he can dress how he wants. It’s not a fashion show. He is good and perhaps he knows he’s good. You know what he said to me when I told him he was playing? He just said: “Bout time!”’

Grealish, on Chelsea’s radar until agreeing a new deal earlier this season, recorded Sunday’s game and celebrated Villa’s win by going home to watch it twice more.

He is refreshingly down-to-earth. This evening Grealish will attend his nephew’s school cup final and present an award, bringing a pair of signed boots, too. 

Grealish joked 'about time!' when manager Tim Sherwood revealed he would be playing against Liverpool

Grealish may draw a larger crowd after Sunday’s memorable Wembley debut in which he played a role in both Villa goals.

There was also a breathtaking moment when he controlled a dropping ball, killing it dead with one touch. It showed why there is an international tussle between England and Ireland for his services.

Watching proudly were dad Kevin, mum Karen, brother Kevan, and model girlfriend Sasha Attwood. They have been together since they were 14.

All are mad Villa fans, Kevin having bought season tickets for his sons since their infancy. Grealish first sat in Villa Park’s Doug Ellis stand when he was four.

The claret-and-blue connection goes back generations. Billy Garraty, his great-great grandfather on his mum’s side, won the FA Cup with Villa in 1905. A picture of Garraty and his team still hangs in the family’s Solihull home.

The FA Cup is the only major trophy Kevin has not seen Villa win. He was in Rotterdam in 1982 as Peter Withe’s goal won the European Cup for Tony Barton’s side.

Now his son could help Villa supply the missing silverware. But had Nottingham Forest not been under a transfer embargo on deadline day in February, this would be a different tale.

Left out of squads by former boss Paul Lambert, Grealish was looking to go out on loan to continue his development. The Forest deal was in place but fell through.

When Sherwood arrived things began to change. Grealish was selected for the huge relegation clash with Queens Park Rangers, and again at Tottenham.

His next objective is to score. When he did that during a loan spell at Notts County last season — five times to help them avoid relegation to League Two — he looked to the skies with emotion. He lost baby brother Keelan to cot death 15 years ago this month.

He also has two younger sisters, Keira and Hollie. Hollie has cerebral palsy and after the win at Tottenham, Grealish gave his shirt to a supporter he saw in a wheelchair.

Grealish knows the hard work has only just started if he is to build on Sunday’s breakthrough performance. He has grafted hard to get to this point. Just don’t count on him pulling his socks up.

A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet

CNN reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. 

Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country.

In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests.

Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed.

'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport.

Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage. 

Of those claims, 2,493 occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee)

Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. 

Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges.

Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports.

'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'

Larry Upright died just one day after Hillary Clinton announced she was running for president . In his obituary , his family made just two requests : Please donate to a children 's hospital , and please do n't vote for Clinton . `` He was very passionate about politics , '' his daughter says .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Larry Upright died just one day after Hillary Clinton announced she was running for president.

And in his obituary, his family made just two requests: please donate to a children's hospital, and please don't vote for Clinton.

Upright, a staunch Republican, died Monday at a North Carolina hospital. He was 81.

"In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to Shriners Hospital for Children," his obituary reads. "Also, the family respectfully asks that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. R.I.P. Grandaddy."

Daughter Jill McLain said it was natural to put that line in her father's tribute.

"He was very passionate about politics and probably passed a little of that on," she told CNN affiliate WSOC.

Son Michael Upright said he knew his father would enjoy the request.

"We know he's up there giggling right now, just laughing out loud," he told WSOC.

Upright's passions included much more than just politics. His greatest joy was his family, and he was a former Shriner of the Year at the Cabarrus Shrine Club, according to his obituary. After retiring from the building automation industry, he became an avid golfer.

But it's the last few lines of his obituary that is spurred comments from across the country.

"You have my solemn promise I will not waste a vote on Hillary Clinton," Marina Shear of Dallas wrote in the obituary's online guestbook.

"You were a wise man, Larry Upright," said Ron Renno of Forsyth, Georgia. "I will remember your request in November 2016. Rest in peace, Sir."

Nigel Dufont of Kannapolis, North Carolina, offered his condolences but said he wouldn't budge on his support of Clinton.

"So sorry to hear about Larry, but I am still voting for Hilary!" he wrote.

And an anonymous commenter stayed open-minded to whoever might enter the field.

"May you rest in peace. I will vote for Hillary if she is the best candidate."

Michael Keaton hosted `` Saturday Night Live '' this weekend . He paid homage to his roles in `` Beetlejuice '' and `` Batman '' Fans were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton 's characters .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)"It's showtime!"

Michael Keaton paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in "Beetlejuice" and "Batman" in his third turn hosting "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.

Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982.

"I had a baby -- he's 31. I also have a new girlfriend -- she's 28," he said.

Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to "play" Batman and Beetlejuice with them.

All they got in response were a couple of one-liners.

Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its "deadpan" manner and "unpredictable weirdness," in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from "Walking Dead" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update.

Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy "She's All That."

Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate.

The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin.

Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a "crazy compliment" and shared a clip from the skit.

-----------------------------------------------
Isis was removed from the official list of future Pacific hurricane names by the UN's World Meteorological Organization, a WMO spokeswoman announced on Friday.

The WMO Hurricane Committee deemed the name inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group.

As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt, Isis had been on the WMO list of names for hurricanes in 2016. 

Isis was deemed inappropriate and removed from the hurricane list by the UN's World Meteorological Organization. As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt, Isis had been on the WMO list of names for 2016

The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico's request to retire the name Odile because of the storm (above)

ISIS is also used to describe the Islamic State militant group, whose forces have captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

The group stands accused of committing brutal atrocities against civilians by UN war crimes investigators.  

Spokeswoman Clare Nullis said from Geneva: 'The Hurricane Committee removed the name Isis from the rotating list and agreed to replace it with Ivette.'

'Names are knocked off the list, which rotates every six years, if they are considered inappropriate if they caused too much damage and too much death.'

She added that this was not the case with Isis.

The WMO has rotating lists of storm names for various regions that run from A to Z alternating between male and female.

The proposal by the WMO regional center was endorsed by the committee.

The group, which is composed of experts from 27 member states and territories, was meeting in Costa Rica this week.

The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico's request to retire the name Odile and decided on Odalys as its replacement to be used for the 2020 season.

Odile hit the popular beach resorts of Baja California last September, stranding thousands of tourists, knocking out power and causing heavy flooding. 

'Tropical cyclone activity during the 2014 eastern North Pacific hurricane season was well above normal,' according to the WMO.

'Most of the tropical cyclones formed from tropical waves which moved from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern North Pacific. 

'Of the 20 tropical storms that formed, 14 became hurricanes, and eight reached major hurricane strength. 

'The hurricane total is the second highest on record for the basin and the number of major hurricanes ties the record for the most. 

'By comparison, the 1981-2010 averages are 15 tropical storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes.'

The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot 's College to skip their year 12 exams and ` buy ' their entry into the sandstone university . The program was devised by the university 's commercial arm , Sydney Learning , and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses . Education Minister Adrian Piccoli has called the shortcut ` unfair ' Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC .
-----------------------------------------------
State Education Minister Adrian Piccoli has called the Scot's College university shortcut 'unfair,' after it was released that school students could buy their way into university without completing their HSC. 

Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 

The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot's College to skip their year 12 exams and 'buy' their entry into the sandstone university.

'Access to university should be fair and equitable,' Mr Piccoli told Fairfax Media. 

'Any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and I will be discussing this with the federal government, which is responsible for universities.' 

Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completed the HSC.   

The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science, animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. 

Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC.

'We have a federal Coalition government intent on linking university admission to wealth, more and more, and these are the sorts of arrangements that flow from the Abbott government's reform of our higher education sector,' he said.

The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that concern within the University of Sydney staff has led to its academic board shutting down this alternative pathway for school students.

Sandstone halls: The University of Sydney's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, has run the pilot program with Scot's College. Pictured above is the university's clocktower and the eastern range of its main building precinct

However, at the time it was shutdown, the board was unaware that Scot's College were planning the pilot with another 11 boys this year. 

My Foley is worried that this pathway will be picked up by other universities and elite high schools.

Scot's College does not advertise their fees for tuition, sport and other curriculum activities, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 per year with an extra $24,121 for boarders. 

Scot's College: Dr Lambert, the college's chief, was quoted telling the Sydney Morning Herald that the diploma was designed with students 'in the middle rank of learners' in mind

Rose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 

'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said. 

Daily Mail Australia approached the University of Sydney and Scot's College for comment on Monday morning. 

Principal Ian Lambert has rejected the notion that it was an exclusive deal for Scot's College.

He agrees that the current HSC grading system works for the top 20 percent of students, but not for middle-ranking students.

New study by Edge Hill University found link between anxiety and grades . 705 pupils from 11 schools questioned in British Journal of Educational Psychology . Principal at Burlington Danes Academy Michael Ribton offers advice to parents . Says parents should draw up revision timetable and reward children with time off .
-----------------------------------------------
The school exam season is nearly upon us; cue a nerve-jangling few months for parents and children alike. 

For many youngsters, the thought of a single desk with nothing more than a white paper on it and a ticking clock nearby fills them with dread. At best, students get jittery, at worst, their actual grade can be affected. 

A new survey by academics at Lancashire's Edge Hill University and the University of South Australia has charted a direct link between anxiety and performance, saying pupils who worry about their exam performance are more likely to do badly than those who are less anxious.

Countdown to the exam season: A new study by Lancashire's Edge Hill University found a direct link between anxiety ahead of taking exams and grades achieved 

The study, which has been published in the British Journal of Educational Psychology, questioned  705 pupils from 11 schools.

Researcher Dr Dave Putwain, Reader in Education at Edge Hill University, said: 'There is no doubt that a high degree of worry over one’s performance, or the consequences of one´s performance, has a detrimental effect on GCSE results.'

He continued: 'Our study, which was controlled for prior attainment and also how good students were at dealing with exam pressure, found that increased worry still predicted lower achievement.' 

With that in mind, how can you best ensure your offspring rides the exam storm and comes out the other end feeling happy and achieving what they'd hoped for?

FEMAIL has enlisted the help of Michael Ribton, principal at Burlington Danes Academy in West London, which achieved an outstanding grade at its last OFSTED inspection, to offer some sage advice to parents and students on how to get through the tricky months ahead.

If Ribton is more than used to getting teenagers to apply themselves in his day job, he's also used to it at home. This summer, his son Joe, 18, will sit A levels, while his daughter Maddy, 16, will take her GCSES.

He says: 'Our May half-term holiday has been cancelled so that they are free to get on with revision. 

'Their bedrooms are adorned with flashcards and files; their revision timetables and exam timetables are on display in the kitchen. It’s a busy time!' 

Principal at Burlington Danes Academy Michael Ribton, pictured above (left) helping a pupil to revise, says parents should pin their offspring's revision timetable on the fridge and really engage with them during the lead up to the stressful exam period

Here, he offers his essential guide to how to ease the passage of students bound for the exam hall: 

DEVISE A BESPOKE REVISION PLAN THAT INCLUDES REWARDS OF TIME OFF 

'Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it. 

'Set yourself goals and reward yourself with time off. A common error is forgetting to add up your cumulative hours on each subject so that you are not overly focusing on one subject.

'Parents need to be part of this as well. A revision timetable should be on the fridge at home! 

'Students also need to find the way that suits them best, though there are some foundation blocks to any revision programme that are essential.

'And know what to revise: exam websites are really useful, but do make sure you know the precise course and paper reference codes.'

Parents should engage with their children at exam time: Test them on anything they need to learn by rote and make sure they get a healthy breakfast and plenty of weekend exercise

FIND A QUIET PLACE, SWITCH OFF THE INTERNET AND DO PRACTICE QUESTIONS

'Students need a place to revise, free from distractions and that includes the internet. Though it contains lots of great support material, it can be quite a distraction. 

'Revision is not simply re-reading exercise books! It ought to be complemented by undertaking practice questions; challenging oneself is an essential core component of revision too.'

Burlington Danes Academy student Fatima Sharif, achieved 4As and 1B grade at AS Level last summer. The student, from White City in West London, currently has conditional offers from five of the country's top universities including Oxford to study English Literature.

Although Fatima doesn't have a definite career plan, she is interested in teaching. Here, she explains how she's currently dealing with revising for her A Level exams: 

Fatima Sharif is due to sit five A Levels this summer and has a conditional offer from Oxford

'In order to motivate myself to revise, I think about what I really want to achieve; being really successful, or getting into a great university, and those thoughts really keeps me going. 

'I set myself a goal, and my continual motivation is achieving that goal, because I know that it will all be worth it if I just put effort into it now. 

'Personally, I don’t really benefit from timetables as I fear that if I am not strictly adhering to them, I am somehow not effectively revising. 

'But I definitely recognise that timetables can be incredibly helpful for students as they give them a set time to work and rest, and they break down the huge amounts of work they have into effective revision time. I would definitely recommend a revision timetable to students.' 

'Although my family hasn't offered me treats if I do well, I have promised myself them! 

During my AS exams I really wanted a Kindle, so I told myself that as soon as I got through the tough exams I’d treat myself to one. 

'I think revision has more significance if you promise yourself something. It doesn’t have to be big, just something small to direct you on the right course.  

FATIMA'S TOP THREE TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL REVISION  

USE REVISION AIDS INCLUDING FLASHCARDS, POST-IT NOTES AND HIGHLIGHTERS 

'Ensure your child has the tools they need to revise and keep in close contact with the school to find out what they advise you can do to help your child.

'At Ark Burlington Danes, we hand out revision booklets (that contain the basic knowledge for all subjects), flashcards, highlighters and post-it notes. 

'We also send text messages, hold intervention classes, cram timetables and do mock exams and questions.'

DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY NEW TECHNIQUES

‘"Spaced Learning" has worked well for us: it’s a ‘cramming’ technique based on neuro-scientific research, which enables the memory process to take place very quickly – quickly enough to cover and retain a whole subject module’s content in approximately an hour.

'A Spaced Learning session consists of three identical ‘inputs’ on PowerPoint slides divided by 10-minute breaks filled with ‘brain gym’ activities. 

'Watching a whole year group learn, say, about theories on the existence of God and then stand up to write their names in the air backwards with their non writing hand is hilarious!' 

Don't despair! A positive attitude is essential for both parents and students

FOR STUDENTS 

Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it

Revise in a quiet place, free from distractions (switch off the internet if you need to) 

Use practice questions to hone technique 

Buy flashcards, post-it notes and highlighters!

Try cram techniques such as 'Spaced Learning' which can train the brain into retaining information

FOR PARENTS 

Get involved! Put your child's revision timetable on the fridge at home

Don't bribe your child: the best prize they can have is education

Ask your offspring to explain their work to you; it'll help them to understand it more fully

Offer to test them on the things that they need to learn by rote

Ensure they breakfast well and exercise together on the weekends 

Be positive! 

HOW CAN PARENTS HELP WITH REVISION?

'Parents play a crucial part.

'Firstly, take a close interest in your child's learning, preferably always but especially at exam time. 

'Ask your child to explain difficult concepts as teaching someone else is the best way to learn yourself. Test them on anything they need to learn by rote. 

'Be positive: high expectations matter and you cannot get away from the fact that exams are a stressful time. 

'All a parent can do is to help their child have the very best chance of success and provide every opportunity for their child to give it their best shot.'

MAKE SURE THEY EAT WELL AND EXERCISE 

'Feed your child properly throughout the exam season; a good breakfast helps and ensure they get a proper night's sleep too. 

'At ArkBDA we provide a healthy breakfast for all pupils and we've found that it really boosts levels of engagement. 

'Know when their exams are, set your alarm clock and get up with them to help them get organised. 

'At weekends, get some exercise together.' 

SHOULD YOU PAY FOR EXTRA TUITION? 

It ought not be necessary in good or better schools, but a tutor can help boost the confidence of a child. 

I would hope the parents at my school would talk with me first before investing money to support their child. An outstanding school would see this as a failure on their part.

BRIBES AREN'T THE ANSWER!  

A good education is a reward in itself, it opens so many doors. Bribes aren't necessary.

Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes lost a leg each in the April 15 , 2013 , blast . They say Dzhokar Tsarnaev ` deserves the ultimate punishment ' But they urge others to ` overcome the impulse for vengeance ' Follows similar appeal made by family of bombing victim Martin Richard . The eight-year-old died in the blast and his sister , Jane , lost a limb . A jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison .
-----------------------------------------------
Boston bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev has been thrown another lifeline by two of his victims.

Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the   2013 marathon, today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker, urging others to 'overcome the impulse for vengeance.'

The couple's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight-year-old boy, Martin Richard, who was killed in the blast. His seven-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg.

This week, after finding Tsaernaev guilty on all 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, attack, a jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without parole.

'We must overcome the impulse for vengeance': Married couple Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes have joined the appeals calling for Dzhokar Tsarnaev to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death

Emotional: The couple who lost a leg each in the blast said their position is highly emotional and practical 

Moving on: Here they are pictured completing the Boston Marathon in wheelchairs on the one-year anniversary

In a statement to The Boston Globe, Kensky and Downes said: 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance.'

They call their position 'intensely emotional and profoundly practical.' 

The victims aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'.

Like the Richards, Kensky and Downes call for life in prison without parole or appeals to ensure Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible.'

The Richards made their appeal in a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published last Tuesday, just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death.

While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. 

No to execution: The family of bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family is pictured on the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard

Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs

Brothers: Tsarnaev's (right) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his extreme older brother Tamerlan (left).  Tamerlan died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police

'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 

'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' 

They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. 

Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013

'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. 

'The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. 

The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. 

Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg.

During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line.

On the day the op-ed was published, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony.

The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. 

However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. 

Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. 

Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot.

A young footballer who tragically died following a freak accident during a first grade rugby game has been described by his club as a well-respected player and all round 'good bloke'.

Nicholas Tooth, 25, was playing for the Quirindi Lions against the Narrabri Blue Boars in mid-north NSW on Saturday when he collapsed after hitting his head on an opponent's shoulder during a tackle. 

He was treated at the ground before being airlifted to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a critical condition but died in hospital late on Sunday.

Nicholas Tooth, 25, died after sustaining a head injury when he hit his head on an opponent's shoulder in a tackle during a first grade rugby union match on Saturday

The young man was visiting his hometown in the New England region of NSW for the weekend

'Nick went in to tackle an opponent and his head clashed with the shoulder and he went down,' Quirindi Lions club president Charles Murray told the ABC.

'There was no foul play, nothing untoward about it at all. Sadly it was just a very tragic accident.'

Originally from Wallabadah in the New England region of NSW, Mr Tooth, who had been working in the agricultural grain industry, was visiting his home town for the weekend.

The young man had been living in Sydney while studying at Sydney University, and tributes have since poured in for the 25-year-old.

Australian Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver told Daily Mail Australia in a statement that the loss of Mr Tooth was 'incredibly sad'.

'The passing of one of our young country rugby players over the weekend is incredibly sad and is a loss that is felt by the entire Australian Rugby community.

'We send our thoughts and sincere condolences to Nick's family, friends, team-mates and members of the Quirindi Rugby and broader community,' he said. 

Mr Pulver also offered his support to Mr Tooth's family, friends, club and teammates.

A college basketball coach, a bar owner and a businessman were among seven killed in a private plane crash as they returned from the NCAA championship game. 

Illinois State associate coach Torrey Ward, meat processing business owner Scott Bittner and bar owner Terry Stralow have been confirmed as among the dead when the Cessna 414 crashed near Bloomington, Illinois, shortly after midnight on Tuesday.

The party had been at the NCAA championship game between Duke and Wisconsin in Indianapolis, and Ward had made a last tweet showing off his transport to the game. 

He posted a picture of an aircraft different to the Cessna on Twitter with the words 'My ride to the game wasn't bad'. 

Bittner was married with a ten-year-old son and a twelve-year-old daughter. 

ISU's deputy director of athletics for external affairs, Aaron Leetch, was also killed in the crash about two miles away from Central Illinois Regional Airport.

A small plane on its way back from Indianapolis, Indiana, crashed near the city of Bloomington in central Illinois

The plane, a Cessna 414 (example pictured), was on its way back from the NCAA championship basketball game 

All seven occupants were pronounced dead by the county coroner, according to McLean County Sheriff Jon Sandage.

The other three occupants were Jason Jones, Andy Butler and Tom Hileman, WJBC reported. 

Jones worked for Wells Fargo, Butler was a regional representative for Sprint and Hileman was the pilot. 

Scott Barrows, the father-in-law of Bittner, said his son-in-law had a regular pilot, the Chicago Tribune reported. 

His son-in-law owned a meat processing business called Bittner’s Meat Company, which is a division of Eureka Locker, the Pantagraph reported. 

He met Barrows' daughter at Illinois State University.  

Barrows said: 'They were supposed to land around midnight. 

'My daughter was called at 4am. There was no contact.

'It has been confirmed they are dead. 

'She's in shock, obviously. 

'It's going to be tough, but we'll be there for them.

'I'll be there for our grandchildren.'

Before coming to Illinois State in 2012, Ward coached as an assistant for five seasons at Ole Miss. 

He also played professionally in China after playing his college ball at UAB.

Like Bittner, Ward is survived by two children. 

ISU's Director of Athletics, Larry Lyons said: 'The Redbird family and the Bloomington-Normal community has suffered a terrible loss today.

Aaron Leetch was a shining star in this business. He had a gift in dealing with people and building relationships. Our external units were making incredible progress under his leadership, and he was on that trip doing what he does best. 

Torrey Ward was a big part of the success taking place with our men's basketball program. He had a big personality, was a talented coach and recruiter, and our fans loved him.

Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of those involved. There is no play in the playbook for times like these. 

We will miss Aaron and Torrey deeply, and we will support their families in any way that we can. To honor their individual and collective legacies, we will move the Redbirds and our community forward.'

Andy Butler was a regional representative for Sprint. He was one of seven people killed in the deadly crash

The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash

Bittner bought the meat business in 1994 and worked alongside his employees on a daily basis.

Stralow was the co-owner of Pub II in Normal.  

The twin engine plane belonged to his father Terry Bittner, according to reports.  

In 2005, Bittner’s became the only “processing facility” in the state of Illinois to receive an Organic Processing Certificate, according to the company's website. 

The company processed hams, bacon, beef sticks and other foods, Farm Show reported. 

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.  

McLean County Sheriff's Department Sheriff Jon Sandage and coroner Kathy Davis spoke at a press conference

There were seven people on the plane when it crashed around 12am, including Bittner, a father of two children

The men on the plane watched the Duke Blue Devils hoist the championship trophy after defeating Wisconsin

Tropical storm Maysak has been classified as a tropical storm . It 's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday.

Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean.

It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday.

Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop.

Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations.

Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora "will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like ... and will be advised to return to their respective places."

Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip.

It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday.

Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be "no ordinary typhoon."

Dry told PNA, "We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall."

Juan Arango 's Tijuana side were losing 4-3 to Monterrey in the Mexican league . Arango went up to Jesus Zavala and bit him on the shoulder . The incident was reminiscent of Luis Suarez 's bite on Giorgio Cheillini 's shoulder .
-----------------------------------------------
Venezuela captain Juan Arango has apologised to a rival player after biting him on the shoulder at the end of a tempestuous Mexican league match.

Arango's Tijuana side were losing 4-3 to Monterrey with just seconds left when he went up to midfielder Jesus Zavala and bit him.

'I did something I shouldn't have done with Zavala,' the 34-year old midfielder said.

Arango (right) earlier scored a magnificent free kick to bring his club Tijuana team level against Monterrey

'I spoke to him after the game and apologised, it was a very hot-blooded game, I got heated up, I took that negative attitude, that isn't me but unfortunately it happened. We exchanged shirts after the game, we spoke and that's it over.'

Zavala fell to the ground and later posted a photo of the bit mark on social media.

The incident was reminiscent of Uryguayan Luis Suarez's bite on Italian Giorgio Cheillini's shoulder during last year's World Cup. Suarez was given a nine-game suspension from international matches and a four-month ban from league action.

The referee in Sunday's Mexican league game ended the game seconds after the bite and did not take action against Arango. The league's disciplinary commission could still punish him.

Tijuana are top of the table with 23 points from 12 games. Monterrey are in 10th on 16 points.

The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected . The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors . TEPCO says the site 's still too dangerous for workers to enter . Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $ 50 billion .
-----------------------------------------------
Tokyo (CNN)A second robotic probe sent into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down.

The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO.

"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation," said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant.

TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles.

The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter.

The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded.

TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route.

The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled.

Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter.

Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete.

TEPCO called the robotic probe an "unprecedented" experiment.

CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.

-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)April 27 is celebrated as Freedom Day in South Africa, commemorating the country's first democratic elections in 1994 election which saw Nelson Mandela elected as president.

The day is widely seen as marking the start of a free South Africa after the fall of apartheid, a system of racial segregation implemented by the white-minority government in South Africa for decades.

This year's celebrations come against the backdrop of a spate of anti-immigrant attacks earlier in April in which a number of people lost their lives.

Using the #FreedomDay hashtag, people across the country and beyond took to Twitter to celebrate this year's event, express their views and send out their wishes -- including the South African government.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also hailed the people of South Africa and sent out a message of hope.

Many South Africans used Twitter to denounce the recent violence...

... whilst others remembered iconic South African freedom fighter Nelson Mandela.

Freedom Day didn't go unnoticed by Google, who've changed the doodle to honor the day.

Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 at Anfield on Saturday . Goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen secured the win . Brendan Rodgers ' side are now four points off the top four . Newcastle boss John Carver admits Moussa Sissoko could have been sent off .
-----------------------------------------------
Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle.

The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield.

With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited.

Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener

Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news.

'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning.

'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.'

Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead

Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created.

Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half.

Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield.

Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf

'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.'

The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle.

Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle.

Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however.

Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City

He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.'

Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.'

While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren.

He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.'

Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball

Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out.

He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede.

'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up.

'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough.

'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'

Former AFL star Ben Cousins left court with a smug smirk on his face following a morning spent in handcuffs and in police custody before he finally fronted court.

Cousins smiled as he left Fremantle Magistrates Court, despite the magistrate labelling him 'a risk to the public' and warning him that he now faces a jail term for the 'serious' offences he has committed.

'It doesn't matter if you're Mother Theresa or Jack the Ripper,' Magistrate Steven Malley told Cousins in court on Thursday, according to ABC News.

'You commit those offences and the legislation says you have to go to jail.

'I accept you have issues but I cannot allow the public to be put at risk.'

Cousins handed himself in to police after failing to make a court appearance over traffic charges

Cousins was supposed to appear in court to face reckless driving charges on Wednesday morning but he failed to show up.

His lawyer Adain Craus represented him during the session and claimed the former West Coast Eagles captain had conflicting medical appointments.

The magistrate had ordered Cousins to produce written evidence of the conflicting appointments before 4pm WST or an arrest warrant would be issued. 

The arrest warrant was issued and on Thursday morning the former AFL star, Perth-based Cousins surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.  

There are reports he is likely to face court later on Thursday

The 2005 Brownlow medallist was arrested on March 11 after allegedly leading police on a low speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park. 

When Cousins finally appeared in court, Magistrate Malley told Cousins his decision not to front up was the wrong one, ascertaining Cousins had followed the 'unwise' advice of his lawyer, Mr Craus.

'When you're on bail you're under an obligation to appear, unless you're strapped to a bed on a drip,' Magistrate Malley said in court.

Magistrate Malley pointed out that there was no legitimate conflict of appointment as court had been scheduled for a 10am start, whilst Cousins' appointment was not until midday. 

The court session would only have lasted a matter of minutes, leading the Magistrate to assume Cousins had been advised not to appear in court by Mr Craus.

Cousins, 36, who has a history of substance abuse, has made headlines several times in the past fortnight after a string of alleged incidents

He was arrested on March 11 after police saw him driving erratically in Bicton and was eventually caught several suburbs away in Mosman Park 

 He was charged with reckless driving, failing to stop and refusing a breath test. 

Cousins has twice been hospitalised for mental health assessments following that incvident - the first time after he breached security at an SAS base in Swanbourne. 

The second time followed seemingly bizarre behaviour in Canning Vale, including climbing on the roof of a house.

The former West Coast Eagles captain has not been charged over those incidents.

Ben and Shelby Offrink met in college at a calculus-based physics study group . In 2014 , Shelby was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in her spine . Ben was also diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma , which he had fought for 15 years . Ben is now on chemotherapy , hoping it will force the cancer into remission .
-----------------------------------------------
Caledonia, Michigan (CNN)Ben and Shelby Offrink met in college. It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating.

"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us," said Ben with a smile.

"He was sneaky," says Shelby.

"Yeah, I wanted to meet her," says Ben, "and that was the best way I could figure out."

Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down.

"I thought it was sciatica," Shelby says of the back pain and the "odd" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. "But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was."

"It" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain.

"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself," Ben explains. "If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself."

Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs.

Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor.

Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to "terminate" them. "You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'" Ben says. "Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor."

As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome.

"I thought it was never a concern again," Ben says. "The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard."

Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond.

"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat," he says. "It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing."

Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children.

"Some days it does feel like a battle," Ben admits. "The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others."

Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly.

"We'd had an amazing support group," Ben says. "Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. "

"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know," adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. "We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot."

This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction?

"I'm not giving up," she says. "Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it."

"For me it's just something that you have to do," Ben says. "You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option."

Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well.

"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of," Shelby says, "and lots of family and friends that care about us."

"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben," said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. "She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope."

The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan.

"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame," Shelby says.

"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us," adds Ben.

"We just can't wait," Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband.

"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting," Shelby says. She breaks into tears: "Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't."

A rescue Sato named Bonnie is so afraid that she will be abandoned again that she can't bear to eat alone.

In an adorable video posted to YouTube by user Jeannine S. with nearly one million views, puppy Bonnie can be seen lifting her dish to bring it over to her canine friend Clyde who is also scarfing down a meal.

Bonnie lifts the dish into her mouth and scuttles her paws backwards to dine along with Clyde.

Given a dish: Bonnie's new owner feeds her a dish of food away from his other dog Clyde 

Clyde continues to focus on his plate and isn't bothered by his new company and from the sound of their names, it sounds like they might become partners in crime-or 'pawtners' in dog speak.

Bonne was rescued from Puerto Rico and is a Sato, which means mixed breed or street dog.

Due to extreme poverty, the streets of Puerto Rico are overwrought with thousands of abandoned dogs.

Luckily for Bonnie she's no longer one of them, she'll have food on her plate, and she won't have to eat alone ever again. 

Wait for me!: Bonnie is so afraid to eat alone that she grabs her dish and paws her way over to Clyde

That's better!: Bonnie and Clyde eat together and it seems as though the two dogs may become partners in crime for life

In 2018, Nasa will launch the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System (SLS).

Tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting Orion to the top propulsion stage of the SLS -will be 11 self-contained small satellites, each about the size of a large shoebox.

Now, the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space.

A concept image of the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout mission, one of 11 missions that will be secondary payloads to the first test flight of Nasa's Space Launch System

'Nasa is taking advantage of a great opportunity to conduct more science beyond our primary focus of this mission,' said Jody Singer manager of Nasa's Flight Programs and Partnerships Office.

'While this new vehicle will enable missions beyond Earth orbit, we're taking steps to increase the scientific and exploration capability of SLS by accommodating small, CubeSat-class payloads.'

The first is a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations.

It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid.

BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit

It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid.

Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration.

The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water.

BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit.

This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before.

'A solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and SLS will get us there,' said Les Johnson, principal investigator for NEA Scout at Marshall.

'It will take us out of Earth orbit and to interplanetary space - where we need to be to deploy the solar sail. It's a perfect ride to begin our mission.'

Nasa's Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration.

The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water.

Lunar Flashlight will use a large solar sail, similar to the NEA Scout sail, to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice.

Meanwhile, BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit.

This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before.

The BioSentinel mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18-month mission.

The experiments will be launched by Houston-based Nasa in 2018 during a test flight of the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System

The missions are a key part of the historic test flight, dubbed Exploration Mission-1.

About 10 minutes after Orion and its service module escape the pull of Earth's gravity, the two will disconnect and Orion will proceed toward the moon.

Once Orion is a safe distance away, the small payloads will begin to be deployed, all at various times during the flight depending on the particular missions.

These CubeSats are small nano-satellites designed to be efficient and versatile.

The masses of these secondary payloads are light - no heavier than 30lb (14kg).

They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space.

'We are expanding the capabilities of this particular SLS test flight,' said Joseph Pelfrey, deputy manager of the Exploration and Space Transportation Development Office at Marshall.

'The rocket will be the strongest ever built by Nasa and we want to take advantage of that design.

'Flying secondary payloads is something we plan to do for missions to come and provide the science community an opportunity they haven't had before.'

This was the heartbreaking sight a Porsche owner had to endure after crashing his pride and joy into a builder's lorry.  

The owner was left devastated after his £80,000 911 Carrera was crushed by a builder's lorry as they both pulled into a side street to move out the way for the emergency services in a suburban street in Nottingham.

Both vehicles had been caught in traffic after a cyclist was injured on a nearby road and police and the ambulance service were rushing to attend the scene.

One onlooker, who witnessed the crash, said: 'The bloke looked absolutely distraught. It was obviously his pride and joy.

'You've got to feel for the man, it was a really nice car. You would be gutted if you were him.'

Seth Casteel 's new book , Underwater Babies , will be released on 7th April . He photographed 750 babies in swimming classes across ten states . The pictures show the babies as they explore the underwater world . Castel hopes to promote water safety for babies .
-----------------------------------------------
Photographer Seth Casteel's unique pictures of dogs swimming underwater managed to captivate an international audience, but now he has a new subject: babies. 

Casteel has found a remarkable new way to capture images of toddlers at their most playful and pure as they dive down into the deep during their first swimming lesson.

The pictures for his new book, Underwater Babies, reveal adorable babies as they explore the underwater world, chubby-cheeked, curious, mischievous, and playful, all captured in his up-close-and-personal signature style.

Oceanic: Nine-month-old Khyleigh takes like a duck to water as she swims towards the camera

His pictures are innovative and take on an air of excitement as the youngsters swim beneath the waves.

Casteel says he was drawn to create his new book, Underwater Babies after hearing of the shocking statistics of the numbers of children that drown. 

Kids between one and four have the highest rates of drowning than any group in the nation. 

'The book is a celebration of babies, but there's definitely a serious element to it,' Casteel told Today.com. 

'A big reason I wanted to make this book is to promote the cause of water safety for babies. I just want to let people know about the benefits of these classes and that they are something to strongly consider.'

He created the book by heading along to water safety classes for babies at swimming pools in ten different states. 

He photographed around 750 babies in schools across each of the states to create Underwater Babies, which will be released on April 7.

Serene: Casteel hopes to use the adorable photos of babies like 4 1/2 month old Michael to promote water safety for toddlers

'I only had a limited window to really seize that moment in time because they can only go underwater just for a moment,' Casteel said.

'I could only take four or five pictures really quickly. Maybe the baby turned or there were bubbles or the instructor got in the way. I was never frustrated because that's the nature of it. You get what you get.'

Apart from promoting his new 70-page book containing his creative pictures, Casteel said that he was eager to get the message across about water safety. 

He was spurred along after hearing a story about an 18-month old baby who drowned in a pool at a family reunion where over 40 people were present, yet the baby died after being left unattended.    

Floater: This 11-month-old named Warren is happy in the few moments he has beneath the pool's surface

Snapshot: Casteel often only had a second or two to capture the images of babies like Emerson who is 7 months old when they briefly went underwater 

The babies in the pictures are being taught to 'self-rescue,' in which babies are taught to hold their breath underwater, kick their feet, turn over to float on their backs and rest until help arrives. 

The technique was pioneered in the late '60s by Harvey Barnett, who at 18 became determined to teach infants to swim after the drowning of a neighbor's child.

His methods have spread around the world and are now taught in numerous clinics and imitated widely.

Underwater Babies by Seth Casteel is published by Headline on 7th April at £11.99.

Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday . Marouane Fellaini gave the Red Devils a 2-1 lead with a header . Ander Herrera has been in impressive form for Louis van Gaal 's side . The Spaniard is now a key cog in United 's well-behaved side . Click here for Manchester United transfer news .
-----------------------------------------------
Manchester United's thumping 4-2 derby victory over City is the latest vindication for the methods of manager Louis van Gaal. 

The Dutchman spent long periods of the season under fire for the disjointed performances of his misfiring team but is now basking in the glory of a dramatic upturn in fortunes.

Convincing victories over Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and City have fans believing in Van Gaal's fabled philosophy.

With a place in the top four all but assured and local bragging rights restored, here are five things the manager changed to transform United.

Here comes the Belgian

Who is this marauding midfield menace? Marouane Fellaini was public enemy No 1 last season, appearing to epitomise everything that was wrong with United under David Moyes. The scapegoat with the funny hair found it no laughing matter and this season has thrived under a manager who is utilising his strengths.

Van Gaal is brave enough and bold enough to throw the big man into the action and give him licence to attack, regardless of aesthetics. If his unplayable form continues, expect sales of those daft wigs outside Old Trafford to rocket.

Fellaini leaps to meet Ashley Young's cross with a header to send Old Trafford into a state of euphoria

Last season, Fellaini struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford and was heavily criticised by fans

Ander-nother one comes good

Some United fans will tell you that they always knew Ander Herrera would do the business, he just needed the opportunity. Van Gaal however, will say that the box-to-box Basque boy is now thriving because he has taken on board his advice. 

The manager bemoaned a lack of composure from Herrera which saw him start just one Premier League match from October to mid-February. 

Since his return he has provided a cutting edge that United lacked until their spring rising. Van Gaal will no doubt claim similar credit for the resurgence of a reborn Ashley Young.

Figuring out what's the Mata

Juan Mata failed to live up to big expectations last season and looked like another who would prove to be a big-money flop. In fairness, it was a tall order to perform in a sinking side and some wondered if, given an apparent lack of pace, he would ever fit in. 

The man who arrived in a helicopter, however, finally has lift-off. Surrounded by willing runners he is now a key cog in a well-oiled machine. Loved by Chelsea fans, he is now close to being adored in Manchester. The Special Juan.

Reputation counts for nothing

Van Gaal has been dropping hints about his philosophy all season. The message came loud and clear when he was asked why he had preferred unproven teenager James Wilson to £280,000-a-week loan man Radamel Falcao.

'If a player cost £95m or £5,000 it’s not any different for me,’ Van Gaal told us. ‘You have to prove yourself.’

It is that mantra that has seen the likes of Falcao, £60m Angel di Maria and old pal Robin van Persie spend large parts of the season checking their backsides for splinters and has paved the way for the re-emergance of the likes of Mata, Herrera, Fellaini and Young.

Record £60million signing Angel di Maria has also been made to sit on the bench by the United boss

Stumbling across a system

Despite snatching unlikely victories, United had laboured for long chunks of the campaign with the atmosphere at Old Trafford often flatter than a (Dutch) pancake.

Not now. The three at the back is long gone and while it might not be the 4-4-2 the frustrated fans chanted for at QPR, the 4-1-4-1 (with a special mention for Michael Carrick) some would say the boss was forced into thanks to injury is not far off. By luck or design it is working.

The Theatre of Dreams is rocking again and the nightmare of last season seems a million miles away.

A mother-of-four whose addiction to Red Bull saw her drinking 24 cans of a day claims she has been cured of her habit by hypnosis.

Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine.

The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink  since she became hooked in 2009.

Scroll down for video 

Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious

Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams.

She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge.

She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control.

She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health.

And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session.

Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure.

A 250ml can of Red Bull contains:

80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso.

27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar.

10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance).

B vitamins.

Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day.

A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose.

Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up.

'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked.

'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do.

'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school.

'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day.

'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function.

'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand.

'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.'

Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world.

Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with David Kilmurry (pictured right)

This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg

The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013.

However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee.

Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day.

A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose.

But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11.

Ms Weatherill, who lives with boyfriend Phil Evans, 27, and four children aged between three and 14, added: 'I knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought I would give hypnotherapy a go.

'It was a weird process, I felt like I was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes.

'All I can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect, I remember him saying I didn't need Red Bull.'

'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person,' Ms Weatherill said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit

She added: 'It was like a paralysis because I had an itch, but couldn't move to scratch it.

'It gave me a lot of strength because in the past I have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the Red Bull.

'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person.'

Hypnotherapist Mr Kilmurry added: 'Sarah's addiction was very serious.

'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape. 

'Energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety and heart palpitations.

'Luckily Sarah soldiered through and has been amazed at the changes.'

Sheriffs are hunting a gunman who shot a young woman through the neck as she was driving down a Colorado interstate, amid fears he may have tried to attack other drivers too.

The unnamed 20-year-old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County, north of Denver, when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck.

In a chilling 911 call from around 11pm Wednesday night, she told operators: 'I'm on the highway right now and somebody just hit me and I'm bleeding from my neck and I'm scared.

'I don't know if they hit me or if they threw something out the window... my neck hurts. I think there's glass in my neck.'

Highway shooting: A bullet passed clean through a woman's neck after she was shot at by an unknown gunman driving down the I-25 highway north of Denver, Colorado

She was taken to hospital where surgeons found she had been shot clean through the neck.

Miraculously, the bullet did not damage the woman's airway or sever any major blood vessels. She is expected to recover, according to 7News Denver.

The woman, from the nearby town of Milliken, said that she had seen a dark SUV just before her window shattered and she felt the gunshot wound.

Deputies from the Weld County Sheriff's Office have said that the shooting may be linked to other unexplained reports of shattered windows on highways in northern Colorado.

Hours before the woman was shot, a man's rear window was shattered as he drove on the nearby I-76 after he heard a 'pop' sound which could have been gunfire.

The previous day a prison van transporting inmates along the I-25 had its window shattered by an unidentified 'projectile', the Coloradoan reported.

Another incident came on Thursday, when a man's driver-side window shattered as he drove down a nearby county road during the daytime. Nobody was injured in any of the other incidents.

Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said drivers should be aware and report suspicious behavior as deputies investigate.

'There's a lot more leg work that needs to be done on this case,' Smith said. 'It's hard because at this point we have no indication that this person was targeted by a person looking for her.'

Deputies were yesterday pictured investigating an abandoned black SUV on I-25, which had shattered rear windows. It is not clear whether this was the vehicle the woman had seen.

Nicola Adams pulled out of the English National Championships . Olympic gold medallist was due to contest the women 's 51kg flyweight division . Adams had been due to fight Great Britain 's Lisa Whiteside on Sunday .
-----------------------------------------------
Nicola Adams has been forced to withdraw from this weekend's English National Championships following a burglary at her home in Leeds.

Adams and other family members were at home at the time but were not aware of the break-in, in which two cars, training kit and valuable personal possessions were taken.

Adams had been due to contest the women's 51kg flyweight division including a prospective final showdown against her Great Britain rival Lisa Whiteside.

Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams has had to pull out of the English National Championships 

Adams said in a statement: 'Nothing makes me prouder than boxing on home ground with the support I get from the nation.

'So, after much thought and discussion with England Boxing, I'm deeply regretful to have to pull out. It's not an easy time for me and my family. We would like to thank everyone for their understanding and support - the boxing team, the police and all my supporters.'

Adams had been due to fight on Saturday in what would have been her first fight in England since her gold medal triumph at London 2012.

Victory was likely to have taken her through to the Sunday final to face Whiteside - a former police officer - who won a world silver medal last year in Adams' injury-enforced absence.

Adams (right) decided not to fight after a burglary at her home, which occurred while she was in the house

The bout at Liverpool's Echo Arena was widely seen to have been an opportunity for Adams to reassert her dominance over her rival as part of preparations for next year's Rio Olympics.

England Boxing chief executive Mark Abberley said: 'The most important thing is that Nicola and her family were unharmed and our thoughts and best wishes are with them.

'We were looking forward to Nicola taking part in the first ever England Boxing Championships in which the men and women's finals are held as part of the same tournament, however it is completely understandable that Nicola does not feel in any fit state to compete and we wish her all the very best in coming to terms with this upsetting incident.'

Tim Cook may have described the Apple Watch as ‘the most personal device we've ever created’ but reports claim the gadget doesn't tolerate some individual’s tattoos.

Owners of the coveted watch have found the timepiece's sensors malfunction when worn on tattooed wrists.

Dark, vibrant ink seems to cause the watch’s heart rate monitor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings.

Scroll down for video 

Some owners of the Apple Watch have found that it malfunctions if worn on tattooed wrists (pictured). Some dark, vibrant ink seems to cause the watch’s heart sensor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings

The issue first came to light on Reddit and Twitter where a number of users reported similar issues, such as having to repeatedly enter a password to unlock the phone.

This is required every time the device detects  it has left a wearer’s wrist.

Tests suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most. 

This is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography.

'This technology, while difficult to pronounce, is based on a very simple fact: Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light, Apple wrote on its support page. 

'Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. 

'When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist - and the green light absorption - is greater. Between beats, it’s less. 

'By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate.'

It is thought that  red and green inks reflect light in a similar way and the sensor can't distinguish between the blood and tattoo. 

It appears  the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch's sensor’s ability to read an individual’s heart rate, which in turn leads the watch to think it has stopped making contact with the skin.

Apple has yet to comment on the problem, despite there being speculation that the apparent fault could also stop some people using Apple Pay.

Tests conducted by iMore suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most. 

This is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography.

'This technology, while difficult to pronounce, is based on a very simple fact: Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light, Apple writes on its support page. 

'Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. 

'When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist - and the green light absorption - is greater. Between beats, it’s less. 

'By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate. 

So the problem seems to occur when a wearer has something on their skin that reduces the lights reflectiveness, such as ink under the skin’s surface.

It appears that the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch's sensor’s (illustrated) ability to read an individual’s heart rate, which in turn leads the watch to think it’s stopped making contact with skin

Reddit user guine55fan thought his 42mm Sport edition watch had a bad wrist detector sensor beacuse it locked every time the screen went dark and wouldn;r receive notifications.

He tried holsing it against his hand, which unlike his wrists and arm, aren't tattooed.

'My hand isn't tattooed and the Watch stayed unlocked,' he wrote.

'Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink the watch would automatically lock again.'

The user has told Apple about the problem who tried to solve the problem, but are also reporting it to their engineers. 

This doesn’t include natural skin pigmentation.

iMore tested the watch’s sensors on tattooed and non-tattooed parts of wrists, as well as elsewhere on the body and found that on non-inked parts, the sensors gave uniformed readings.

However, ‘on tattooed sections, sensor readings varied wildly depending on colours and shading,’ Serenity Caldwell reported.

She said  solid colours in darker inks such as black and red ‘confused’ the sensor the most, causing misreadings of up to 196 beats per minute (BPM), for example.

The average heart rate is 72 BPM.

Tests on lighter colours such as purple and yellow caused slightly elevated misreadings of 80BPM, compared to 69BPM on the wearer’s non-tattooed wrist, but didn’t interfere with skin contact detection, unlike with darker shades of ink.

The team was unable to reproduce problems reported on Twitter of light, but patterned tattoos creating errors, leading them to conclude that the design and type of tattoo makes a difference in how well the watch works.

Apple has yet to comment on 'tattoo-gate' but admits on its support page that 'many factors' can affect the performance of the Apple Watch heart rate monitor. 

'Skin perfusion is one,' it says.

'A fancy way of describing how much blood flows through your skin, skin perfusion varies significantly from person to person and can also be impacted by the environment. 

'If you’re exercising in the cold, for example, the skin perfusion in your wrist may be too low for the heart rate sensor to get a reading.'

Apple said that motion is another factor. 'Rhythmic movements, such as running or cycling, give better results compared to irregular movements, like tennis or boxing.' 

The sapphire glass screen in the Apple Watch has remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer.

The test was carried out by Cardiff-based iPhone repairs specialist iPhoneFixed.co.uk, which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm Apple Watch for its experiment.

Two out of the three models of Apple Watches have sapphire glass screens - the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition.

The glass is made from synthetic sapphire, which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder, before the crystals are processed to remove impurities.

The tiny round disks created are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass.

Sapphire glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond.

To test the durability of the screen, it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin, before being ‘scratched’ by a key.

The video capturing the attempts at destruction, shows no scratches were achieved to the screen.

It also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard.

But most impressive, was the screen’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface, without leaving a mark.

The test led iPhoneFixed to claim: ‘Sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch’.

-----------------------------------------------
Tim Sherwood has branded Aston Villa’s stars ‘icing on the cake players’ — urging them to toughen up before they host Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday night.

Villa’s mini-revival has been halted by back-to-back defeats and Sherwood believes his star names must dig deep to avert their relegation crisis.

He said: ‘You look through QPR’s side and they’ve got a lot of players who are men with a lot of experience.

Sherwood believes his star names must dig deep to solve their Premier League relegation crisis

‘We’ve got a few men — but a lot of pretty much icing on the cake players. I’m trying to get that mentality into them to start digging out results. It’s not what we’re cut out to do.’

Sherwood insists Tuesday night's clash is the most important of his managerial career — and that the same goes for most of his squad.

‘For me, this is the biggest,’ he said. ‘This is huge for them and they have to be able to take it. If they can’t handle it, don’t be at this club and don’t be at the bottom of the league.’

QPR will be without striker Eduardo Vargas on Tuesday evening, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee ligament injury.

The 25-year-old Chilean international, on loan from Italian club Napoli, was hurt after scoring the opening goal in Saturday’s 4-1 win at West Bromwich Albion.

Vargas will be out for 10 to 12 weeks and will miss his side’s seven remaining matches.

-----------------------------------------------
LeSean McCoy's acrimony with Chip Kelly continues to rumble on, with the Buffalo Bills running back taking another swipe at the Eagles head coach.

McCoy was shipped to the Bills in exchange for linebacker Kiko Alonso and says Kelly's team has a college feel and that he doesn't like star talent.

'I don’t think he likes or respects the stars. I’m being honest. I think he likes the fact that it’s "Chip Kelly and the Eagles",' he told the Philadephia Enquirer.

LeSean McCoy warms up as he takes part in a voluntary offseason conditioning session with the Bills

McCoy clearly has a chip on his shoulder about the trade, but slated Philadelphia's 'college feel'

'It was "DeSean Jackson – a high-flying, take-off-the-top-of-the-defense receiver". Or "the quick, elusive LeSean McCoy". I don’t think [Kelly] likes that.'

Since arriving at Rex Ryan's Bills last month, McCoy says he's already at ease with his surroundings before launching another swipe at Kelly.

'Here is more of a NFL type of feel,' McCoy told NFL's Total Access.

'Being with Coach [Andy] Reid for so long... you get used to that. A player's coach. An NFL type of atmosphere in the locker room and around the facility. And for two years in Philly it wasn't like that as much. Not in a negative way, but it was different. It was more like a college feel.'

McCoy ran for 1,000 yards in four of six seasons with the Eagles and still spoke of his surprise at the move.

'Now you put my numbers up. You put my [numbers] up and you’ll see it. It tells you it. In any system – Andy [Reid] or Chip. So I’m not going to go there, back and forth with that. I just feel like the only thing I didn’t like was the respect. For so many years I gave you all what you wanted. You know? And then for how it went down, it was like a surprise. I’m thinking, "Does everybody look at it how I look at it?".'

As well as their trip to Wembley this year to face the Jaguars, Buffalo also travel to Philadelphia in what already promises to be something of a grudge match.

-----------------------------------------------
Bruce Jenner could be sued by the stepchildren of the woman who died in the Pacific Coast Highway car crash earlier this year - despite the fact they had 'virtually no relationship'.

Kim Howe's two adult stepchildren are said to be considering suing the former Olympic athlete turned reality television star following her death.

Mrs Howe was driving a white Lexus, which Jenner's Cadillac Escalade rear-ended on a segment of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on February 7.

Crash: Mrs Howe, 69, died after being involved in a four-way smash with realtiy TV star Bruce Jenner

Crash: Mr Jenner is said to have 'rear-ended' her white Lexus, which was pushed into oncoming traffic

The car was pushed into oncoming traffic, and collided with a black Hummer, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck. 

According to TMZ, the two step-children are said to have 'lawyered up', because they are the only people who could launch a wrongful death suit.

Mrs Howe's husband Robert died in 2003, and it is understood she has no other close living blood relatives. 

Attorneys have previously warned 'the sky's the limit' if it came to a court case, with juries able to award huge amounts. 

However, sources close to the investigation have said Mr Jenner - who was not hurt in the incident  -  is only insured up to $250,000, meaning he may have to pay out from his personal finances.

It is believed he shares an $125million fortune with his ex-wife, Kris Jenner. 

No charges?: Sources close to the investigation believe Mr Jenner won't be prosecuted for manslaughter

Court case: However, Mrs Howe's stepchildren could still sue for wrongful death

Proof: Sources told TMZ that one of the step-children had been asked to find pictures of the pair together

Police sources say he is unlikely to be prosecuted by the Sheriff because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash.

However, that still leaves the possibility of a wrongful death suit. 

Close friends of Mrs Howe have told the celebrity website she had 'virtually no relationship' with either of her late husband's children, neither of whom live in California.

Sources went on to tell TMZ that one of the step-children had been asked to find pictures of the pair together, to prove their relationship - and therefore the amount its loss has cost them. 

Former couple: Bruce, shown in May 2011 with Kris Jenner,with whom he shares a $125million fortune

New York-born Mrs Howe, who was childless, was  'very socially active', according to one member of the exclusive community in Calabsas, where she lives alongside the likes of Jenner's Kardashian stepdaughters.

Jim Pascucci, a realtor who lived in the neighborhood, and also sold the Howes their $2.5million house, told the New York Daily News she was 'sweet' and 'charitable'.

According to the newspaper, she had put aside an amount of money to go towards animal charities -an sum which could be in the millions.

-----------------------------------------------
Eight guards at Nauru detention centre have been suspended after they posted anti-Islamic messages on social media and were pictured with Pauline Hanson at a recent Reclaim Australia rally.

Detention centre operator Transfield Services said the employees – who are part of Nauru's emergency response team - were found to be contravening a company policy that they display 'cultural sensitivity'.

A former staffer at Transfield subcontractor Wilson Security said the guards – seven of whom are former Australian Defence personnel - 'frequently referred to asylum seekers in their care as "the enemy"', The Guardian Australia reported.

Some of the guards were found to have posted on their Facebook accounts promoting the controversial Reclaim Australia rallies – which were held around the country on April 4 to protest against Islamisation and the influence of 'minorities' and 'radical extremism' in Australia.

All eight men were pictured posing with former federal MP Pauline Hanson – well known for her anti-immigration and anti-Halal stance - at the Brisbane Reclaim Australia event.

In other social media posts some of the guards compared Muslims to Nazis while others accused companies with Halal-certified products of supporting terrorism.

One guard, Harley Levanic, posted a picture to Facebook in February of a new neck tattoo bearing the word 'infidel' and tagged a number of other guards asking 'Who is next boys?'

Another guard, Beau James, commented on the photo: 'Welcome to the gang… Well done old son. Looks awesome.'

Harley Levanic posted an image of a new neck tattoo reading 'Infidel' with the caption 'Who is next boys?'

Mr James appears in a Facebook photo wearing a T-shirt bearing the 'infidel' slogan, and on the day before the Reclaim Australia rally he commented on a post linking Muslims to Nazis with the comment 'See yas tomoz boys!!! Bring your pitch forks', the Guardian Australia reported.

Fellow guard Simon Scott – whose Facebook profile has now been deleted – posted messages slamming companies for carrying Halal-certified products.

'Don't be UnAustralian and buy these products. Let the filthy sub human genetic Islamic filth have it,' he posted.

Mr Scott also claimed that detention centres were '90% full of wealthy Iranians' in Facebook comments that have been deleted but still appear on Google search cache.

And on a post detailing a plan to settle refugees bound for Australia in Cambodia, Mr Scott wrote: 'I don't care where they send them as long as they don't send them to Australia.'

Alan Hartley shared a pro-military cartoon with the caption: 'This picture shows why we all have to go to the take australia back rallies around the country before we lose what guys like these sacrificed their lives for that islam and its muslim extremists are trying so hard to disrespect and destroy!!!!!!!!!! [sic]' 

Transfield Services spokesman David Jamieson said the guards had all made social media posts that breached company policy, in addition to being pictured with Pauline Hanson.

'It's not just the picture,' Mr Jamieson told Daily Mail Australia.

'What they are alleged to have done appears to contravene policies we have around acceptance of cultural diversity.

'These sorts of actions are totally unacceptable and we're very concerned. What is alleged to have been done is in no way representative of the broader workforce on Manus and Nauru.'

Mr Jamieson said the men had been stood down while an investigation was being conducted, and he did not know how long it would take.

When asked if the company now planned to monitor the social media accounts of other guards, Mr Jamieson said: 'I'm not going to comment on what we might or might not be doing.'

Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer was in 'shock' as he watched his goalkeeper Simon Eastwood almost snatch a last-gasp draw for his side against Liverpool. 

Trailing 1-0 following Philippe Coutinho's 70th-minute strike, Eastwood left his post guarding the Blackburn goal and arrived in the Liverpool penalty area in a bid to help his side draw level with seconds of the contest remaining. 

Bowyer had looked ready to celebrate the latest of equalisers after Eastwood skilfully controlled the ball before testing his Reds counterpart Simon Mignolet with a tricky drive.

'I think it was more shock that he managed to do that and turn,' said Bowyer. 'It was an unbelievable turn from him... a last roll of the dice.

'Our group's an honest group and they have had a right good go.

'To have pushed Liverpool like that over two games and still have a chance like that means there's nothing but praise for them.

'It shows the progress we've made at the club and the supporters have hopefully gone away pleased with what they saw, but just a little bit disappointed that we couldn't get the goal.'

Meanwhile, Jordan Henderson believes Liverpool's 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Blackburn will give his team-mates a much-needed lift heading into the Barclays Premier League run-in. 

The Reds settled the replay through Coutinho's second-half strike and will now play Aston Villa in a Wembley semi-final on April 19. 

Liverpool's charge towards the Champions League places has been curtailed by defeats to Manchester United and Arsenal but midfielder Henderson feels the Ewood Park result will help get things back on track.

'It was a really important game for us today,' he told BT Sport. 'I think everybody has been disappointed over the last couple of weeks with performances and results.

'But I think we showed great character today. We knew when we came here they'd make it difficult for us but from start to finish we controlled the game, I thought we were brilliant.

'Towards the end when we'd gone 1-0 up they were chucking everything at us but we defended fantastically.

'Credit to the lads really and we'll go to Wembley against Villa and I'm sure it will be a tough game because they're a good side.

'But it gives everyone a lift.'

He added: 'Philippe's got a great football brain and the easy bit was just giving him it and he finished it fantastically well.

'That little bit of brilliance from him wins us the game and gives everyone a big lift.

'Hopefully now we can kick on over our last seven games in the Premier League and in the semi-final.'

On the run: Clarence Taylor, 44, remains at large after police in Akron, Ohio ordered his arrest in connected to a bizarre 'faked kidnapping' last fall

A man is on the run after police charged him with faking his own kidnapping in a bizarre incident last fall. 

Police say Clarence Taylor, 44, faked his own kidnapping by duct taping his mouth and tying himself to a tree in Akron, Ohio. 

On November 1, Taylor's 45-year-old girlfriend called police, saying he had been missing for several days. 

While she was on the phone with investigators, the girlfriend received a call from another of Taylor's friends who said he had found him tied to a tree with zip ties in a wooded area near Stoner Creek and Pickford Ave. 

That unidentified man then led police to Taylor, who was strangely still bound to the tree. It's unclear why his friend did not cut him down initially.

Police then released Taylor and took him to Akron General Medical Center. 

Taylor told police that a group of men tied him to the tree after stealing $2,500 from him. 

He says he was walking down Beechwood Drive when he saw the men with shotguns who abducted took him and took him away in their van. 

Taylor claimed to have been left tied to the tree for several days, despite not showing any signs of dehydration or injuries consistent with being out in the cold and rainy weather for an extended period of time. 

Police have since charged Taylor with a first-degree misdemeanor charge of falsification. A warrant was issued for his arrest last month but Taylor remains at large.

Police have not revealed the reason for the warrant's four month delay or a motive behind the fake kidnapping.

Calls to the Akron, Ohio Police and Summit County, Ohio Sheriff's Office were not immediately returned Monday morning.

A 'greedy' cashier who stole £15,000 from a currency exchange and blew it on living a high-flying lifestyle was told by a judge it was time to 'get her hands dirty'.

Fashion conscious Shanice Farier, 22, from Derby, earned a 'decent salary' and received handouts from her father but that wasn't enough for her expensive taste, the court heard.

She helped herself to money from Kanoo Travel in Derby and spent it staying in hotels and living 'an opulent lifestyle', said Judge John Burgess.

Farier appeared at Derby Crown Court highly made up, wearing a figure-hugging dress and clutching an expensive-looking handbag, and even posed for pictures outside court.

The Judge ordered Farier (pictured) to 240 hours of unpaid work, adding: 'I hope she ends up doing work that gets her hands dirty'

Judge Burgess chastised her for her greed before ordering her to do 240 hours of unpaid work, adding that he hopes she will 'get her hands dirty'.

The judge said: 'She's got all the advantages in life. She's not a person who needs help with a gambling, drug or drink problem. She's just greedy.'

He then turned to her and added: 'Unpaid work for the community is not intended to be humiliating, but I hope for every hour you are doing it, you remember why you are there.' 

She was involved in handling different currencies for the firm but on 12 separate occasions she took money for herself before entering the remainder into the company's books.

Farier admitted stealing of £15,336 from her employer between October 2012 and February 2013 and converting criminal property between January 2013 and February 2014.

Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said said she hadn't worked for Kanoo long before she started stealing and they soon noticed 'an unusual pattern of discrepancy emanating from the Derby office'.

Farier was questioned but denied any wrongdoing and even tried to point the finger at other employees.

But her dishonesty was exposed and she was subject to an internal disciplinary procedure and dismissed.

Mr Lody said: 'She began working for the company in March 2012 and it wasn't long before she started stealing from her employer. Perhaps she didn't realise how tightly financial systems are controlled.' 

Stuart Newsam, for Farier, said: 'This offending is out of character. She didn't consider the consequences of her actions and thoroughly regrets now what she did.'

Judge John Burgess said Farier had told the probation service that she thought 'it was too easy'.

The judge handed her a 10-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months, with 240 hours of unpaid work, adding: 'I hope she ends up doing work that gets her hands dirty.' 

A spokesman for the company said: 'Kanoo would like to thank Derbyshire police for their handling of the investigation and has nothing further to add to the judge's comments in court.'

A proceeds of crime hearing will be held at Derby Crown Court on June 23.

Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Hibs have the easier run-in . Rangers are level on points with Hibs but have played a game less . Stuart McCall 's men still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts , including Sunday 's match at Ibrox .
-----------------------------------------------
Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season.

His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign.

But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long.

Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in

Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more.

HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a)

RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a)

'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray.

'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday.

'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points.

'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win.

'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.'

Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox  

The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six.

Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday.

But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down.

Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table.

'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others.

'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal.

'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'

Luke Rockhold staked his claim in New Jersey as the top middleweight contender in the UFC.

Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York.

Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night.

'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.'

Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort.

Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage.

Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center.

'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.'

Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida

Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session

MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen

The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG.

'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said.

Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event.

Souza won with an armbar submission at 2:33 of the first round.

Souza needed less than five minutes to earn victory and also wants a middleweight title shot

Souza, who lost to Rockhold in his Strikeforce days, hoped he could earn a shot at Weidman's title with a fight against Olympic silver medalist Yoel Romero. But when Romero was injured, Camozzi stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight.

Souza won his eighth straight UFC fight and hoped a month ago a win would mean his name would get called next for a middleweight title fight.

Machida-Rockhold and Souza-Romero would have been a Final Four showcase of the best of the UFC middleweight contenders. But Romero's last-minute scratch meant Souza likely has a longer wait for the biggest fight of his UFC career.

'I want to get the shot at the title next,' Souza said. 'It's my time. I'm coming off five victories.'

Pep Guardiola went into Bayern Munich's Champions League second-leg against Porto under intensifying pressure after a 3-1 defeat in the first encounter.

His side responded ruthlessly, obliterating Porto - and Guardiola's doubters - with a relentless attacking display and a 6-1 scoreline at the Allianz Arena to reach the semi-final but it is not just the blistering offensive play that seizes the front pages in Germany on Wednesday.

That honour is taken by Guardiola's trousers, which tore at the top of his leg during the game.

Guardiola had a tear in his trousers as he orchestrated Bayern's big win from the sidelines against Porto 

Bild lead with the picture of Guardiola's trousers and the headline '6-1! It even bursts Pep's pants!'

Kurier took a more reserved approach the morning after the match, leading with the headline 'safety for fixed Bayern'.

The reaction in Portugal was much more damming after Porto's humiliating demolition. 

'Terror in Munich' reports Abola, who reflect on a 'tragic half hour' where Bayern blitzed Porto with three strikes to overturn to the 3-1 deficit, before going on to notch another three, reaching five at half-time.

Record simply lead with 'disaster' on their front page, adding that Porto had 'the worst defeat in their European history.'

Supermodel Twiggy, 65, shows off her age-defying looks as she models her new summer range for M&S

Twiggy has long been working for the high street store - and has seemingly taken inspiration from the 70s trends seen on the catwalks this season.

Her new designs include a chic denim jacket, floral and feminine print dress and leopard-print trousers.

Whilst she looks flawless in the new shoot, the fashion stalwart has admitted that while she has never had cosmetic surgery, she hasn't entirely ruled it out.

She told Woman Fashion magazine: 'I haven't had any cosmetic surgery – yet. I'm not saying I never would, but at the moment, I don't feel I need to. 

However, the model added: 'But I am totally against Botox. Firstly, it's poisonous – I don't want botulism in my body thank you very much. Secondly, we don't know the long-term effects. Doctors say it disappears in the body, but where? And I don't like what it does to people's faces.'

Twiggy, who is married to actor Leigh Lawson, 69, takes a relaxed approach to ageing and seems at peace with her advancing years.

'There's nothing you can do about getting older. You've just got to accept it,' she said. 'It's no good locking yourself away in a room and crying on your birthday.' 

Twiggy's short cropped haircut helped propel her to stardom in the swinging Sixties, but nearly 50 years later, she is embracing her longer locks and will not be pressured into cutting them short.

Twiggy - real name Lesley Hornby - has rubbished the beauty rule which says that as a women gets older, her hair should get shorter.

She has blonde hair that falls well past her shoulders and is the face of L'Oreal hair products. 

Now and then: Twiggy's short cropped haircut helped propel her to stardom in the swinging Sixties, but nearly 50 years later, she is embracing her longer locks and will not be pressured into cutting them short

Tory party chairman accused of doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself . He is accused of deleting embarrassing references to his past from his own page . Also accused of putting unflattering updates on pages of others including Justine Greening and Lynton Crosby . Mr Shapps has denied the claims calling them an ` extreme dirty tricks campaign '
-----------------------------------------------
Grant Shapps was last night at the centre of extraordinary claims that he was doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself at the expense of his political rivals.

The Tory party chairman is accused of deleting embarrassing references to his past from his own page in the online encyclopedia while putting unflattering updates on the pages of others.

A furious Mr Shapps denied the claims, published by the Guardian, describing them as an ‘extreme dirty tricks campaign’. 

David Cameron defended Mr Shapps, saying that the party chairman is doing 'a great job' while on the campaign trail today. 

Scroll down for video 

Grant Shapps, pictured campaigning with Esther McVey yesterday, has been accused of changing Wikipedia pages to promote himself and damage rivals

Mr Shapps has denied the allegations claiming they were part of 'an extreme dirty tricks campaign' 

Wikipedia has suspended an anonymous user of the site, known only as ‘Contribsx’, after finding evidence it said suggested the account was run either by Mr Shapps or under his ‘clear direction’.

It cited a series of amendments made by the user to pages of the site, around one third of which involved removing embarrassing references on Mr Shapps’s own page.

Other changes included adding critical language to the pages of Tory Cabinet ministers including International Development Secretary Justine Greening and campaign chief Lynton Crosby.

The timing and content of some of the edits appear to tally with instances when Mr Shapps clashed with the subject of the changes. 

The Tories described the story as ‘completely false and defamatory’.

Last night Mr Shapps said: ‘It’s categorically untrue. It’s absolutely nothing to do with me. It’s just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.’

But it emerged in 2012 that changes to Mr Shapps’s Wikipedia page were made from computers in his constituency office.

At the time, he said he had amended pages claiming he was ‘a Jehovah’s Witness, agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall’.

A Wikipedia account using the alias 'Contribsx' edited a number of pages linked to Mr Shapps and other prominent politicians

Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits

When Mr Cameron was asked if he has 'full confidence' in Mr Shapps today, he replied: 'Grant does a great job. He has made a very clear statement about this and I have got nothing to add to that.'

The Conservative chairman told the BBC: 'This is one of the most bonkers stories I think I have seen during this election campaign. Absolutely, totally without foundation.

'It seems to be based on the word of a single Wikipedia anonymous editor who, for all I know, is a Labour Party apparatchik.'

An investigation by Wikipedia claimed the Contribsx account ‘is a ‘sockpuppet of Grant Shapps’ previous accounts on Wikipedia’.

Sockpuppet refers to a fake online identity used ‘for an improper purpose’ and is banned on the site. 

Among the changes revealed include information about Miss Greening, who had disagreed with Mr Shapps over his support for a third runway at Heathrow. In September 2013 the user said she ‘failed to vote in a critical parliamentary division about military action in Syria’ as she failed to notice the division bell had sounded, despite being in the House of Commons.

The user also made edits on Mr Crosby in March and August last year, at times when there were reports of splits between the two men. Mr Shapps took the blame after the 2014 Budget over a ‘patronising’ picture he tweeted about cuts in beer tax and bingo which would help ‘hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy’.

Contribsx edited Mr Shapps’ Wikipedia page to suggest he had unfairly taken the blame for the picture, which was the fault of Mr Crosby and Chancellor George Osborne.

In September 2013, Contribsx added these passages to Justine Greening's Wikipedia entry, highlighting her opposition to the expansion of Heathrow and an embarrassing incident in the House of Commons

The user added the highlighted text about the gay marriage bill to Dominic Grieve's page

Mr Shapps's Wikipedia page stated that he had edited the site 'removing negative information', as shown in the highlighted text top image, but Contribsx changed it to cast the minister in a better light

A recent Contribsx edit, on Easter Sunday this year, changed the page of Karl Turner, the shadow attorney general, adding a reference to the Labour MP having ‘admitted breaking House of Commons rules by sending out invitations to a £45-a-head Labour party fundraising event from parliamentary email’.

Two weeks earlier Mr Turner had called on Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate Mr Shapps over his denials that he had continued to use the pseudonym Michael Green while he was an MP.

Wikipedia is like a normal encyclopedia but its pages can be created and edited online by anyone. Volunteer administrators moderate the site and monitor changes. Changes to pages create an audit trail which can be linked back to users.

Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth said: ‘This is another embarrassing episode in the saga of Grant Shapps. It’s about time we had some answers, from him and from David Cameron who appointed him to run the Tory campaign.’

Liberal Democrat campaign chairman Paddy Ashdown sent a light-hearted press release that read: ‘Grant is a wonderful guy - he is a credit to the Conservative Party, a fine sportsman and reads a book a day. We could all learn a lot from him. Quite simply, a colossus.’

The press release noted that it had been ‘edited by Wikipedia user Contribsx’. 

Mr Shapps's own Wikipedia page was edited by Contribsx in March 2014 to shift the blame for a controversial tweet on the Budget to George Osborne and Lynton Crosby; the passage in question is pictured before and after the edit

A passage added to Vince Cable's page by Contribsx drew attention to his alleged disloyalty to Nick Clegg

The highlighted passage appeared on Labour MP Karl Turner's Wikipedia page after it was edited by Contribsx earlier this month

In a statement released last night, Mr Shapps said: 'It is untrue from start to finish, and was quite likely dreamt up by the Labour press office. Sadly it is typical of the smears coming from those who would rather not debate policy and substance.' 

A spokesman from Wikimedia UK, the UK charity that supports Wikipedia, told The Guardian: 'We would welcome any MPs who choose to become editors, and are happy to provide training sessions to anyone who wants to learn.

'However, the Wikipedia project is founded on trust, and anyone who tries to deceive our volunteers and readers in order to further their own ends should think very carefully about the morality of what they're doing. Eventually, the public will find out.'

The Tory chairman who gave himself a false identity

Tory chairman Grant Shapps is nicknamed the Duracell bunny for his seemingly unstoppable energy and his willingness to appear on any TV show to defend the government.

But it is another name – Michael Green – for which he has become infamous in recent years. Green was an alter ego that Mr Shapps used to promote get rich quick products before he became an MP.

The revelation that he had used the alias even prompted a man to change his name to Michael Green by deed poll to stand against Mr Shapps in his Welwyn Hatfield seat in next month’s election, in the hope of embarrassing him. 

Grant Shapps, pictured, created the alter ego Michael Green as part of a get-rich-quick scheme

It all adds to the perception of many of his political rivals that there is something not quite to be trusted about him.

Mr Shapps, a 46-year-old father of three, was first elected in 2005. Five years later, he became a housing minister in the incoming Coalition government.

Since September 2012, the qualified pilot has been Conservative Party chairman, charged with masterminding a campaign to win the 2015 general election.

His supporters say he is an effective media performer; often wheeled out by party high command to defend the party’s policies.

As fellow Tory MP Nick Boles said: ‘Somebody said he’s the Duracell bunny of the Conservative party. I did laugh at that because it’s a rather apt description.’

A populist politician, who is a self-confessed fan of restaurant chain Nandos, Mr Shapps is from a different background from many others in his Cabinet, which is often perceived as being populated by public school toffs.

Born in Watford, he was schooled at the local grammar school. His cousin is Mick Jones, guitarist of punk rock band The Clash. Mr Shapps’ brother even played with Jones in another band, Big Audio Dynamite. 

Mr Shapps posted this controversial tweet after last year's Budget and was criticised for allegedly being patronising

Mr Shapps joined the Jewish youth organisation BBYO and later became its national president. At the age of 20 he was in a coma for a week after being involved in a car crash in the US. A decade later he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but went into full remission after chemotherapy.

The future Tory politician studied business and finance at Manchester Polytechnic, and upon leaving university he set up a successful printing business.

Later he started writing self-help guides for a website called HowToCorp, advising people on how to get rich quick – a job which has earned him a ‘loadsamoney’ nickname.

He wrote the books under an alias, Michael Green – and a photograph of him wearing a badge with the name at a US conference came to light in 2012.

Last month he had to admit that despite saying he had stopped using the name on election in 2005, he was still using it in summer 2006. Three years ago, claims first came to light that he had allegedly altered his Wikipedia entries; changing sentences which he said were inaccurate – such as that he was a Jehovah’s Witness.

It emerged that changes were made from computers in his constituency office.

And some have claimed he has followed and de-followed people on Twitter to increase the number of his followers.

The grandmother of a Virginia teen missing since March 2 came out swinging Sunday at authorities who she says have been 'doing nothing' to bring the girl home.

Katherine Hadsell says she's eager for police in Norfolk to give 'more insight into what they're actually doing' to find 18-year-old college student Anjelica Hadsell.

The Longwood University student was home for spring break when she vanished. Police just this past week focused their search on a pond near Carrsville after getting a new tip that her cell phone may be below its surface.

Concerned? Katherine Hadsell says police aren't doing enough to find 18-year-old AJ, who's been missing for a month. Further, she says her son - AJ's stepfather Wesley Hadsell - was arrested unjustly as he took it upon himself to investigate the crime by breaking into a Norfolk area home

Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2.

Meanwhile, the family says they've been left in the dark about how, exactly, police were led to the pond in the first place. 

And Hadsell's stepfather has found himself the focus of area police after he was caught allegedly breaking into a home two weeks after Anjelica's disappearance, an act his mother Katherine says was out of fatherly concern.

Katherine Hadsell told ABC News her son Wesley had heard his stepdaughter could be inside the home.

'As any father would, if you hear that your daughter may or may not be in a house or being held or some of her belongings or at a location, any father is going to try and find out,' Katherine Hadsell said. 

Hadsell had not been named a suspect as he awaited a hearing on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. 

Local resident Steve Hines over the weekend said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance.

The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to 13 News Now. 

Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing.

He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road.

He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. 

The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter.

He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours.

He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will.

Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges

Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond

'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com.

Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. 

He said he even punched the family dog out of anger.

While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket.

'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said.

'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' 

Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects.

During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition.

He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. 

In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states.

Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped.

Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month

Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month

He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. 

Now he says that he is a changed man. 

Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance.

Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. 

Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. 

He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home.

A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her.

They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time.

AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake.

Four items were found that belonged to her.

AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.

-----------------------------------------------
Comics at the BBC must go through a lengthy process to get some jokes on air because the Corporation is extra-wary about causing offence, an editor at the company has claimed.

Chris Sussman, executive editor for comedy, revealed particular jokes have to go through 'quite a lot of layers' to be approved.

Some jokes even have to be looked over by director general Lord Hall - alongside editorial policy advisers, the channel and legal advisers - before they are aired, he said.

Comics at the BBC must go through a lengthy process to get jokes on air, including some being looked over by director general Lord Hall (left), an editor at the company claimed. It is because the Corporation is extra-wary about causing offence - like in the Sachsgate scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross (right)

The cautious attitude comes after a 'difficult few years', Mr Sussman added.

Speaking at a Bafta event The Telegraph reported him saying: 'It's been a difficult few years and I think that is reflected internally in terms of the processes and procedures we go through when we’re making programmes.

'To get a certain joke on air, to get a joke approved, we have to go through quite a lot of layers.

'Sometimes we’ll run something past at script stage, if we’re unsure. Most of the time it’s about "here’s the show, have a look at it".'

The strict rules come after a 'difficult few years' following the Sachsgate scandal, where Ross and Brand left lewd messages on Andrew Sachs' (left) voicemail, Mr Sussman added. Comedian Frankie Boyle (right) has previously criticised the BBC about its cautious attitude towards comedy

Mr Sussman joined the Corporation after Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand caused outrage by broadcasting a series of answer phone messages they left with Andrew Sachs. The messages included lewd comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie.

Comedian Frankie Boyle has previously criticised the BBC about its cautious attitude towards comedy. 

He called the Trust cowardly for the broadcaster’s lack of political comedy in 2010 shortly after leaving Mock The Week. In an open letter Boyle added that the BBC wanted to 'deliver the flavour of political comedy with none of the content'.

John Lloyd,  producer of Blackadder and Not the Nine O'Clock News, added that comedy that is not funny could 'sink the corporation'.

-----------------------------------------------
A  father is desperately searching for his 13-year-old daughter, who hasn't been seen since last Thursday.

Melissa Borg left her Baulkham Hills home in north-west Sydney at 7:30am on Thursday in her school uniform and made her way to The Hills Sports High School in Seven Hills. 

However, the Year 9 student never made it to class and after her father found no sign of her when he searched their house following work, he reported his daughter missing to police. 

13-year-old Melissa Borg (pictured) has been missing from her Baulkham Hills home since last Thursday 

Castle Hill Police have been assisting Melissa's family with the investigation into her disappearance ever since. 

Melissa is described by police as being 150cm with a slim build, long brown hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing her school uniform - a dark blue skirt and a pale blue blouse.

Police have questioned her school friends about her mysterious disappearance, however they have so far been unable to find the child. 

Melissa's parents are extremely concerned at her out of character actions and are worried about her young age.

The teenager left home at 7:30AM and made her way to The Hills Sports High School in Seven Hills 

Speaking to news.com.au Inspector David Hogg said  police were holding out hope that Melissa was with friends.

'With any 13-year-old that goes missing for this time frame it's serious but our hope is she's with some friends and just doesn't want to contact her family,' Inspector Hogg said.

'If that is the case, whatever issue she has, we'd hope that she'd at least get in contact with police so we can get in contact with her family and let them know she is okay.'

Inspector Hogg told the publication that there were unconfirmed sightings of the 13-year-old in the Merrylands area.  

However Melissa never made it to class and her father alerted police to her disappearance when he arrived home from work and she was nowhere to be found  

Melissa's family and friends have taken to their Facebook pages to share a photo of the teenager in her school uniform. 

A picture posted online by Melissa's aunt Tricia Carlow has already been shared over 2,000 times around the Sydney area.

'My niece Melissa Borg is missing from the Baulkham Hills area since Thursday afternoon 02nd April 2015,' the caption said. 

'Can you please share this around and keep an eye out for her. We at least need to know that she is safe and well.'

In what is being described as a horrific accident, 20-month-old Kendra Moad of Kearns, Utah followed her grandfather, who has not been named, out of the house as he pulled his truck forward so he could move some garbage cans.

He did not however see the toddler in front of his truck and killed her.

He did not see the toddler and ran her over as he pulled his truck up in the driveway (above) to move the trash cans and ran over and killed the 20-month-old

'He got into the red Chevy pickup truck parked at the residence to pull it forward so he could move the garbage cans and unfortunately the child managed to get under, in front of car and he ran over the child,' Unified Police Department Lt. Justin Hoyal told Fox 13.

'Very tragic situation here today.'

Kendra suffered severe head trauma and was unconscious when medical workers arrived, and was pronounced dead shortly after at a nearby hospital.

This is now the fourth time since August that a child was accidentally run over and killed in their own driveway by a family member in Utah.

The grandfather is not facing any charges at this time, but the case remains under investigation. 

'No family member ever wants to go through something like this, and so it’s always important that when you are pulling out, you’re backing out of your driveway: Just take that extra second to check and make sure there is nobody, none of the children have followed you out, or nobody is around your vehicle,' said Hoyal.

Another woman, Catherine Somani, 23, was also stabbed in the abdomen as she apparently tried to break up the fight, WABC reported. She was believed to be the suspect's girlfriend.

'They were engaged in a verbal dispute in front of the location,' said Officer Sophia Mason, an NYPD spokeswoman. 'The males engaged in a confrontation, and that's when the 22-year-old male stabbed the 31-year-old male'

Weapons: Photos taken from a Facebook count that appears to be associated with Bleary show a man accustomed to handling a weapon

Injured: Chris Copeland, a player for the Indiana Pacers, and his wife, Katrine Saltara, pictured, were both stabbed following an argument outside a New York City club early on Wednesday

A video shared with TMZ shows the victims on the sidewalk as they are attended to by emergency responders. 

'We were both stabbed,' Saltara can be heard saying. 'We were attacked out of nowhere by a f***ing black civilian. We have nothing to say. We are scared for our lives!' 

Murdock, from Brooklyn, was arrested at the scene along with two fellow NBA players, Pero Antić and Thabo Sefolosha of the Atlanta Hawks.

The players allegedly obstructed the crime scene as police arrived by refusing to get out of the way, according to sources.

Authorities recovered a knife from the scene, sources told the New York Daily News.

Copeland and his wife were both listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, while Somani was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening. 

Cuffed: Pero Antic, who plays for the Atlanta Hawks, was arrested for failing to clear the scene for police and he is seen being escorted out of the 10th Precinct of the NYPD on Wednesday

Injured: Video by a passerby shows Copeland and his wife on the ground before they were taken to hospital

Scene: The couple was stabbed by a man who interrupted them as they argued outside 1OAK in Chelsea

CBS reported that Copeland underwent surgery on Wednesday morning. 

'We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City,' Indiana Pacers President Larry Bird said in a statement to DailyMail.com on Wednesday.

'We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured.'

The team confirmed that he had suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen.

The fight broke out down the street from 1OAK, a popular Chelsea club where celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan have been spotted partying.

The couple is believed to have only been inside the club briefly. 

The Hawks and Pacers are both in New York for basketball games. 

Together: The couple, pictured, was rushed to Bellevue hospital where they are in stable condition

Loved up: The couple are seen in a picture taken after their engagement in September 2013

Copeland, who is from New Jersey, was supposed to play his former team, the New York Knicks, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. 

He previously played 56 games for the team in his 2012-2013 rookie season.

Both Pacers and Knicks fans flocked to social media to wish him a speedy recovery on Wednesday.

'Hope that you and your wife have a speedy recovery,' one fan wrote. 'Once a knick always a knick.'

The Hawks will take on the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center, but it is not yet clear if the two arrested players will be available to play. 

'We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning,' Hawks spokesperson Garin Narain told DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time.'

On the court: Copeland previously played for the New York Knicks (pictured in 2013). He was in New York to take on the team on Wednesday night but was undergoing surgery on Wednesday morning for his wounds

Arrested: Atlanta Hawks' players Thabo Sefolosha, left, and Pero Antić, right, were arrested for allegedly failing to leave the scene when police arrived. All three players were in the city for games on Wednesday

Odds on the second royal baby being called Sam have been slashed . It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge 's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend . The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed ` The Royal Matchmaker ' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance .
-----------------------------------------------
Odds on the second royal baby being called Sam have been slashed, following the success of Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree, the Duchess' close friend

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. 

Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. 

It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend.

The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be.

Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1.

David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.'

Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name.

He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1

'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.'

The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild.

Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. 

At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. 

The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25

Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National 

Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National.

In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding. And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin.

Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' 

The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25.

The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured)  

That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April.

The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant.

She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. 

But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to £10,000.

Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household.

Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.

Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne in the face of grid girl Liu Siying . The 23-year-old was a podium model at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday .

-----------------------------------------------
The podium girl is the centre of a 'sexism storm' after Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne in her face said she wasn't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job.

The British Formula 1 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23-year-old grid girl Liu Siying, who was pictured looking less than impressed.

But the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art graduate, who was a 'podium girl' at the Chinese Grand Prix, said she didn't think much about the incident and wasn't annoyed.

Liu Siying was pictured grimacing as Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne at her face after winning the race 

Sexism campaigners called Hamilton's behaviour 'selfish' but Siying said she did not think too much about it 

The hostess said: 'I was told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did'

'It lasted for only one or two seconds, and I did not think too much about it at all,' Miss Siying told the Shanghai Daily.

'I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media.

'I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that’s what I did.'

Miss Siying had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai because she was a fan of Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen. 

After the incident on Sunday, Object, a campaign group against sexism, condemned the behaviour of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate' and called on Hamilton to apologise to the graduate. 

Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his actions showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'.

It's not the first time racing ace Lewis Hamilton has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot

After seeing the pictures the chief executive of campaign group Object asked for Hamilton to apologise  

Speaking on Monday, Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object said Miss Siying would have had ittle choice but to 'stand there and take it'.

She said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part.

'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it.

'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position.

'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.'

Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world.

Hamilton also sprayed a hostess at Montmelo after winning the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya

She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women.

On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'.

Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.'

And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.'

It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table.

And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013.

But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' 

Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday.

But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference.

His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.

With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’

Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. 

The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race.

'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' 

A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race.

'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him.

'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.'  

The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded.

It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team.

This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.

Cheryl Prudham , 33 , and husband Robert , 30 , plan to renew wedding vows . Couple are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for a two-week ` no expense spared ' break . They will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love .
-----------------------------------------------
She costs taxpayers more than £39,000 a year in benefits.

And now Cheryl Prudham, a pregnant mother of 11, is blowing some of that cash on a £10,000 trip to Las Vegas, it was reported yesterday.

The 33-year-old is said to be planning to renew her wedding vows with her husband Robert, 30, during the ‘no expense spared’ jaunt.

Shameless: Cheryl Prudham, 33, who receives £39,000 in benefits, and her partner Robert are spending £10,000 on a lavish ceremony in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows

Browsing: The couple, who hit headlines last year after demanding a bigger council house for their huge brood, visited her local Thomson travel agents in Kent to book the luxury family break 

The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city.

Mrs Prudham – who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent – plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony.

The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. 

They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported.

It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ 

The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000. 

Planning: The duo are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for the two-week 'no-expense spared' break

Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London

They managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit.

The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham’s five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online.

But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him.

She said: ‘We’re good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’

Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is ‘too cramped’. 

Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. 

The brand’s handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match.

Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag – thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with.

Happy families: The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife’s five youngest children

Huge brood: The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000

When it comes to glamour, the bride is expected to be the centre of attention on her big day.

But when Andy Murray and his long-term girlfriend tie the knot today, Kim Sears will have stiff competition from the mothers.

Judy Murray, 55, who has had a makeover since her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing last year, is said to have spent months planning her outfit. 

But she could be outshone by Leonore Sears, 53, who has long been admired on the tennis circuit by gentlemen of a certain vintage.

The ceremony, in Murray’s home town, Dunblane, is being hailed there as the event of the year. 

One charity shop has displayed mannequins of the bride and groom, while many are calling it Scotland’s royal wedding.

Dunblane Cathedral has been decked out with trees for the ceremony – perhaps inspired by the way Westminster Cathedral was decorated for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.

Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, who met ten years ago, were initially expected to marry in the small chapel at Cromlix House, the luxury hotel owned by the tennis star.

The former Wimbledon champion has said the wedding will not be a star-studded affair, with the biggest name on the guest list likely to be former British No 1 Tim Henman.

The couple are also said to have delayed their honeymoon until the end of the year to accommodate Murray’s tennis schedule.

Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908 . It caused consternation in America for one simple reason : Johnson was black . A great cry went up from white America to find a white challenger -- a ` Great White Hope ' -- who could unseat the new champion . It would take over six years before Johnson would be defeated , on April 5 , 1915 , 100 years ago on Sunday .
-----------------------------------------------
From the moment Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908, a frenzied search began.

While Johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in America for one simple reason: Johnson was black — and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize.

Racism was rife in America: black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit Bert Sugar put it, 'This was the white man's crown. (To white America), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.'

After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion

It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that Johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as The New York Times, were openly hostile to the giant Texan.

It mattered little that Johnson was American. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white America to find a white challenger — a 'Great White Hope' — who could unseat the new champion.

But little did white America know that it would take over six years before Johnson would be defeated, on April 5, 1915, 100 years ago on Sunday.

Most had believed Johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock Johnson down. Yet Johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of Ketchel's teeth in the process.

Attention immediately turned to finding another 'white hope'. There seemed an obvious choice: former world heavyweight champion James J Jeffries, who had retired undefeated in 1904. Jeffries, who as champion had dodged Johnson, was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were.

Things didn't go as planned. Six years out of the ring had taken its toll on Jeffries and in 1910 Johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds, further enraging whites who rioted, taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate Johnson's win. As many as 26 black people would be killed by lynch mobs.

What made Johnson even more unbearable to white America was the way he lived his life. A fun-loving character, Johnson dated and married white women, and refused to live according to the social norms of the time. He was intelligent, eloquent and ambitious and saw no reason why his being black should hold him back from doing whatever he wanted.

Like Muhammad Ali years later, he was a trailblazer. He suffered dreadful discrimination, death threats and later persecution at the hands of the government. He took most of it in his stride.

The same cannot be said of his detractors whose efforts to unseat him became increasingly desperate. In 1912, one opponent, 'Fireman' Jim Flynn, was disqualified for repeatedly trying to headbutt Johnson.

Things were getting ridiculous, but Johnson's life outside the ring was unravelling. He spent money like it grew on trees and was being investigated by the US government on the spurious charge of abducting his future second wife under what was known as the Mann Act, a dubious piece of legislation designed to prevent 'white slavery'.

He was found guilty by an all-white jury and sentenced to a year in prison. Johnson had other ideas. He fled to Canada and then to Europe, fighting three times in Paris, where he made history by beating 'Battling' Jim Johnson in the first-ever all-black heavyweight championship bout.

Next he outpointed American Frank Moran over 20 rounds, though the purses for the fight were frozen after a dispute. With his money running low and the First World War breaking out in Europe, he accepted the challenge of another 'white hope' from America. His name was Jess Willard, a 6ft 6in fighter, known as 'The Pottawatomie Giant.' To put Willard's size into perspective, the average height of an American man at the time was 5ft 7in.

The fight would take place in Cuba and was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, a hell of a distance given the 40-degree heat on the day.

How would Johnson, now 37, handle a challenger four years his junior? The champion had, quite arrogantly, barely trained for the fight. Still, Willard was certainly the underdog: his size meant he was not particularly agile and he did not like hurting opponents unless they had hurt him first. Johnson was supremely confident.

Johnson dominated the opening 10 rounds but his lack of conditioning soon began to tell. His breathing became heavy, amid the sweltering heat, and Willard grew in confidence.

The writing was on the wall at the end of round 25. Johnson, sat on his stool, called over fight promoter Jack Curley. 'Jack, go take my wife away...tell her I'm awful weak and I want her to leave.'

In the next round Willard seized his chance. He faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with Johnson's jaw. Johnson slumped to the canvas and took the count flat on his back. It was the victory that white America had been waiting for but was all as it seemed?

Action from the world heavyweight title fight between Johnson and Willard in Havana, Cuba in 1915 

Photographs of the knockout appeared to show Johnson shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall. His motivation, Johnson said, was a $50,000 payout and a promise from the American authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence.

Johnson's 'confession' was sold for a fee to Nat Fleischer, the respected founder of The Ring magazine. But Fleischer never believed Johnson, while Willard was bitter about Johnson's claim, especially as the victory was his finest hour. 'If he was going to throw the fight I wish he'd done it sooner,' Willard said. 'It was hotter than hell out there.'

Much of the public believed Johnson and they had not seen the film of the contest as there was a ban on it being shown. It would take 40 years for the footage to see the light of day. When it did surface, Willard was vindicated, the film clearly showing him land a powerful blow. 'I've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when I say I that I beat Johnson fair and square.'

Willard confronted Johnson over his claims in 1944. 'I asked him why he made his false statement,' Willard recalled. 'He just shrugged and gave me that gold-toothed smile of his. Jack knew and I knew he was lying. But the fella was desperate for money, so who could blame him.'

Johnson would eventually end his exile and continue fighting into the 1930s. Tragically he would die in a car crash in 1946, speeding away from a diner that refused him service on account of his race. Willard would lose his world title in only his second defence, suffering an awful beating at the hands of Jack Dempsey before retiring to his farm in Kansas.

Johnson was defeated after enduring 26 rounds in the sweltering Cuban heat, compared to 'hell'

They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double.

The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference.

Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week.

So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith.

Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side.

The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes.

Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards.

Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert.

But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes.

Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal.

Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell.

The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart.

Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game.

At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points.

Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost.

However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith.

Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards.

Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

Real Madrid will not take up their £7.5million purchase option on Javier Hernandez despite his winning goal against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. 

Manchester United and Real Madrid agreed a potential deal last season worth around £15m to include the Mexican's season loan. 

Lazio, Valencia, Dinamo Moscow, Newcastle, West Ham and Southampton are among clubs interested in the 26-year-old.

The Mexican is wanted by a host of Premier League clubs including West Ham and Swansea

Hernandez has only started twice in La Liga for Carlo Ancleotti's side and faces the near-impossible task of earning a regular starting spot with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale ahead of him in the pecking order.

The striker will return to Manchester United at the end of the season but does not feature in manager Louis van Gaal's plans and will only have one year left on his contract at the Old Trafford club. 

Meanwhile, LA Galaxy and proposed new franchise LAFC are being considered by Ronaldo as possible destinations when his contract ends at Real Madrid. Ronaldo, 30, is contracted to Madrid until 2018.

-----------------------------------------------
Sharon Winters was searching for her soulmate when she met Kevin Hawke on an online dating site - but less than two weeks later she was dead after he stabbed her in a brutal knife attack.

Now her brother Stephen Robinson, 44, from Wirral, Merseyside, is speaking for the first time since his sister's murder, to warn other women to be careful when looking for love online.

The father-of-seven said: 'She was a lonely heart just wanting love. That animal preyed on her caring nature.'

Sharon Winters, pictured here with her brother Stephen Robinson, was looking for her soulmate online

Kevin Hawke has been jailed for 17 and a half years for murdering Sharon  in a frenzied attack triggered by an argument over what to watch on the television

Mr Robinson told how his 39-year-old sister suffered more than 90 injuries after  Hawke stabbed her in the liver, spleen, lungs and heart with a four-and-a-half inch knife.

He said that the vicious attack was triggered by a row over what to watch on the television.  

Afterwards, the 33-year-old killer, who had drunk 15 pints and a bottle of vodka over the course of the day, had a beer before calling the police.

Hawke was jailed for a minimum of 17-and-a-half years after he admitted the murder in July last year.

Liverpool Crown Court was told Hawke, of no fixed abode, moved into Ms Winters' house after just one date, and started being very controlling with her. 

Mrs Winters suffered from depression and had learning difficulties and Mr Robinson said: 'I still can't believe someone would want to hurt my poor, defenseless sister in such a horrific manner.'

Devoted aunt Sharon is pictured here with her niece Ellie, Stephen's daughter

He had begged her to end the relationship after hearing that Hawke would 'push his sister around'.

But Ms Winters told her brother that she was 'just desperate to be loved' and stopped speaking to him.

Mr Robinson said: 'She continued her relationship with that monster.'

Just three days later, on July 13, 2014, police found Ms Winters dead in her flat in Liverpool.

He is now determined that his sister's death will not in vain and is appealing for women in violent relationships to seek help, and be cautious when online dating.

'Sharon was the kindest, most loving sister. All she wanted to do was find her soulmate,' he said.

'She wore her heart on her sleeve. She was kind and caring - a lovely woman.'

Ms Winters, who was unable to work due to depression, started going on dating websites in 2013.

Father-of-seven Mr Robinson disapproved, fearing that men were taking advantage of his susceptible younger sister.

He said: 'I used to check up on her all the time, I was incredibly protective.

Sharon Winters was lonely and felt that Kevin Hawke was the only man who wanted her; Sharon, pictured with her mother Ann, had very low self-esteem, says her brother Stephen

'One day when I was taking her over some shopping, I noticed she was looking brighter, and she told me she'd met someone online.

'She showed me their messages to one another and I was horrified. They were very sexual and he'd even sent her pictures of his privates.

'I feared he was just after one thing, and told her as much. She said that chatting to men online made her feel good about herself.

'She got frustrated by my disapproval, so I dropped the subject. I just begged her to meet these dates in busy places.'

However, Ms Winters would often invite men she met online back to her home, meeting them there face-to-face for the first time.

Mr Robinson said: 'For all her amazing qualities, my sister lacked common sense. She'd been bullied throughout childhood and felt like she was worthless, that she was unlovable.

'My wife Helen and I tried to build up her self-esteem, and our children loved spending time with their aunty.

Stephen is trying to raise awareness of the dangers of online dating after his sister lost her life at the hands of a man she met on the internet

Stephen Robinson describes his sister as a 'lonely heart who just wanted love'

'But at the end of the day she just wanted someone she could share her life with.'

Ms Winters thought she'd found that someone when she met Hawke, a chef, on a dating website.

Mr Robinson said: 'From the off she was smitten. She called me up after meeting him for the first time, saying it was love and that he was moving in.

'I was concerned, but didn't say anything to Sharon. I knew it would upset her. Instead my wife and I arranged a dinner with the new couple, only Kevin didn't show.

'We rescheduled for the next day and the same thing happened again. By now I was also hearing rumours that Kevin was being aggressive towards Sharon, so I pleaded with her to end it.

'All she said was, "no one else wants me'", and it was heartbreaking to hear.'

Mr Robinson's pleas fell on deaf ears, and Ms Winters stopped talking to her brother. It would be the last time they'd ever speak.

He said: 'We had a bit of an argument about it, and three days later I called her to apologise.

'She didn't pick up her phone, which was odd, so I decided to head over to see her. I quickly checked the football scores before I left.'

As Mr Robinson checked his local news website, he also saw a news story so devastating it would change his life forever. 

He saw a picture of his sister's home with the headline: 'A 39-year-old woman has been found dead in her flat.'

He said: 'I felt sick to my stomach. I called the police who told me the news, Sharon was dead.

'I knew immediately who had killed her. We were eventually told Kevin Hawke had called the police after killing my sister, and had been charged with her murder.

'As we waited for the trial I planned Sharon's funeral. We had a butterfly theme as they were Sharon's favourite – delicate and beautiful, just like her.'

During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court Mr Robinson heard how the couple had been rowing over what to watch on TV. An alcoholic, Hawke had drunk 15 pints of lager and a bottle of vodka.

Stephen, pictured here with his daughters Sophie (left) and Ellie, on a trip to Sea World, begged Sharon to meet online dates in a busy public place rather than at her house

Mr Robinson said: 'It was horrendous to listen to. Apparently Sharon had begged for her life and held her hands up to protect herself. If only I'd been there.

'He was savage, her injuries were unbelievable. He'd even ripped through her ribcage.

'When the judge sentenced him to life in prison it was justice of sorts, but all I really want is my beloved sister back.

'After the case we went to get Sharon's belongings, and you could still see blood on the walls even through the flat had been cleaned. It must have been a bloodbath.'

Now Mr Robinson is trying to raise awareness about domestic violence as well as letting women know the dangers of online dating.

'I hope by telling Sharon's story, people will be more wary about who they are chatting to online and make sure, if they do meet up, it's in a busy public place.

'Kevin was aggressive towards Sharon before he killed her, and I wish she'd gone for help.

'Instead my poor sister suffered in silence, with tragic consequences.'

Laura Robson took the opportunity to cool down in the Florida heat on Thursday while she dipped in an ice bath as the British tennis nears a return to action after more than a year off the court.

The 21-year-old has not played since the 2014 Australian Open more than 15 months ago after requiring surgery on an injured wrist.

But Robson, who has been training in Tampa in a bid to build up her fitness in time to take part in next month's French Open at Roland Garros.

Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff

Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff yesterday.

They read: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah.'

Posters were stuck on lampposts and bus stops across the Grangetown suburb telling the Muslim electorate: 'Islam is the only real workable solution for the UK'.

Cardiff Council have begun removing the posters, dubbed 'chilling' and 'threatening' by locals. 

The full message on the poster reads: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah and decides what is permissible or impermissible for mankind, based solely on their whims and desires.

'This leads to a decayed and degraded society where crime and immorality becomes widespread and injustice becomes the norm.

'Islam is the only real, working solution for the UK.

'It is a comprehensive system of governance where the laws of Allah are implemented and justice is observed.' 

Local parent Greg Pycroft, 36, was with his two-year-old son when he came across 20 posters plastered on his walk to nursery yesterday.

The Welsh Government worker  said: 'It was quite chilling and threatening to see these posters.' 

Cardiff Council says any religiously motivated or offensive stickers will be removed as a priority.

Grangetown councillor Ashley Govier said: 'People have a right to vote and that needs to be respected. Grangetown is a very tolerant area but it's got to go both ways.

'If they do choose not to exercise their right to vote, that's their business but we're trying to encourage people to do so and this is unhelpful and not very nice.'

Mr Govier said the council's response has been immediate and 'pretty incredible'.

Sahar al-Faifi, of the Muslim Council of Wales, said the anti-voting posters were put up in response to the voter registration campaign in Cardiff for the last three months.

Miss al-Faifi added: 'The reason behind these posters is we have had such a successful voter registration campaign across mosques in Cardiff.

'We have been doing it every Friday for three months to encourage worshippers in an unpartisan way to participate in their civic duties.

'Most mosques were on board and the hateful people behind these posters do not represent us.

'The mosques believe they can be part of the political process of this country.'

The groups Muslim Council of Wales, Hope Not Hate and CitizenUK have been leading the voter registration action across the Cardiff suburbs of Cathays, Grangetown and Butetown.

-----------------------------------------------
Czech immigrants were trafficked into the UK by a Roma family on the promise of a 'better life' were forced to work for free and sleep in cupboards, a court was told.

The victims were lured to Britain but were 'treated like dogs' - being made to urinate in buckets and live and eat outside in winter, prosecutors say. 

The jury heard how the workers were kept under duress amid fears for the safety of their families back home and sent to work in dog food factories, food plants and car washes in Plymouth, Devon.

But they were made to give over all their wages, forced to eat outside during the winter and do housework to pay off 'loans' for their board and passage, a jury heard.

Accused: Petr Tancos (left) and sister Ruzena Tancosova (right) are on trial for people trafficking in Plymouth

The allegations of their shocking treatment were made during a trial of five family members at Plymouth Crown Court.

Ruzena Tancosova, 34, brother Petr Tancos, 35, cousin Martin Tancos, 35, Nela Dzurkova, 26, and Katerina Kurejova, 35, all of Plymouth, are charged with people trafficking. All deny the charges.

Police say victims would be threatened with violence by the gang who pocketed their wages and benefits - believed to be around £150,000 - and even made them shoplift.

Malcolm Galloway, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the five defendants, all members of an extended Czech Roma family, brought the immigrants over. 

He said a neighbour also saw one standing by and directing one of the men to cut grass with a kitchen knife.

He said: 'These defendants entered into a criminal agreement to traffick other Czech nationals into the UK and then exploit them for financial benefit.' 

Mr Galloway said: 'They (the immigrants) came with a promise of good pay, a job and a future.'

Mr Galloway said the family used various methods to exploit the men - including for example putting a notice on the toilet door charging £1 for its use.

But the court heard that the men were also threatened with violence if they failed to comply.

He said: 'They would put them up in their houses in Plymouth. The Czech nationals would sometimes have to sleep on the floor, outside in the garage.

'They would have to urinate in buckets and eat outside.'

He added that police started surveillance after two immigrants went to the authorities. Officers then searched their properties on September 16 last year.

The court heard one man, Josef Bukovinsky, told police he had been 'living with the gypsies' in the Czech Republic before he was 'sold to Ruzena' (Tancosova).

On trial: Nela Dzurkova (left) and Katerina Kurejova (right) are part of a Roma family accused of illegally trafficking Czech migrants into the UK and 'treating them like dogs'

Mr Galloway said he was one of 11 men who lived with Tancosova in less than three years at a former address in Plymouth.

All five defendants are charged with conspiracy to traffic individuals into the country for the purpose of exploitation between April 6, 2013, and September 16, 2014.

Tancosova, Petr Tancos and Dzurkova are also charged with the same offence again but applying to an earlier period between January 1, 2010, and April 5, 2013.

Tancosova and Martin Tancos are further accused of acting as gangmasters in supplying workers to pack agricultural products.

Tancosova and Petr Tancos also allegedly required a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2014.

Mr Galloway told the trial that Tancos was seen by neighbours at different addresses to supervise the immigrants.

He said a neighbour of Tancos and partner and co-defendant Nela Dzurkova spotted three men apparently living in their garage.

The woman told police she saw Dzurkova passing food out of the kitchen window to men who stood in the garden of the house eating from trays in winter.

He said: 'She also saw Petr Tancos standing by and directing one of the men to cut the grass with a kitchen knife.'

He said the man was on his hands and knees.

Mr Galloway said the neighbour noticed that Petr Tancos encouraged his children to throw stones at the men.

She estimated that between 10 and 12 men lived at the home at different times.

Mr Galloway said another immigrant, Miroslav Ritter, stayed with Petr Tancos and Dzurkova at their last address.

He added: 'He slept, in his words, like a dog under the window in the living room, in a gap between the table and window.

'He slept on the carpet with a blanket and a pillow.'

Jan Banyak told police he stayed at the home of Martin Tancos and Kurejova and £600 a month in rent to sleep on the kitchen floor.

Mr Banyak believed that he earned about £250 a week working in a factory, but he did not know where the money went. He only received about £10 from Martin Tancos.

Mr Galloway said: 'He told the police they usually had to eat outside. There were 10 of them and Katerina Kurejova did not want them inside as there were only two rooms. They eat mostly tinned food.'

He added that when police raided the address, they found two other men sleeping on mattresses, under the stairs and in the kitchen.

Mr Galloway said Tancosova, who had four bank accounts, pocketed £86,517 in benefits over four years and eight months.

He added: 'The credit turnover for the accounts, including benefit payments, amounted to £148,923.'

Mr Galloway said police had not been able to trace everyone they suspected of staying at the rented homes of the family.

The trial continues.

-----------------------------------------------
George Osborne was challenged 18 times yesterday to explain where the next Tory government would find the extra £8billion it has promised the NHS.

During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for.

Mr Osborne said it would come from the Conservatives’ ‘balanced plan’ for the economy, but declined to go into further detail.

Scroll down for video 

Chancellor George Osborne and Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman, appearing on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show

In one exchange, Mr Marr said: ‘You’ve just found an extra £8billion. All I’m asking is where does it come from? No higher taxes, extra public spending cuts? Where?’

Mr Osborne replied: 'Well it’s part of our balanced plan. And if you look over the last five years …’ But Mr Marr interjected: ‘That’s not really an answer, Chancellor.’

Harriet Harman was left squirming yesterday after ‘posh’ George Osborne revealed on the Andrew Marr show that they had attended the same £21,000-a-year private school. 

She went to St Paul’s Girls’ school in West London while Mr Osborne attended the boys’ school. 

During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for

Mr Osborne insisted, however, that the Conservatives had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the NHS.

Migrants will have to pay in more than £20,000 in taxes before they receive access to the benefits system under Tory plans.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the new rules would end welfare tourism and make the UK less attractive to Eastern European migrants.

New arrivals will be banned from claiming benefits until they have paid into the system for four years. The plan to ensure that they have to pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance before they can claim a penny will be part of the Tory manifesto.

European job hunters would be denied unemployment benefits and forced to leave within six months if they do not find work.

Those who get a job would be denied in-work benefits, including council housing, for four years. They will also be refused child benefit for offspring living anywhere else in Europe.

‘We have a balanced plan to grow our economy, to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our NHS each and every year,’ he said.

‘We have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years.

‘We have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £8billion extra in real terms for the National Health Service in very, very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle, we have proved our ability to stand behind the National Health Service in this parliament. We can do it in the next.’ 

Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, who also appeared on the programme, said the promise was ‘illusory’ and that Tory spending plans represented a ‘real threat’ to the health service.

‘The reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the NHS,’ she said. 

‘People know that they find it harder to see their GP since the Tories came into government, they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow.’

The video shows the moment the packed vehicle starts to swerve from side-to-side on what appears to be a dual carriageway.

One of the back doors is left open and the van is seen veering across both lanes of the road.

As the driver loses control of the vehicle, it rides up on to its two righthand wheels.

Seconds later, it can be seen crashing down on to its side sending the men on the roof rack flying.

The van was travelling at such speeds that it carries on travelling some 50 metres down the carriageway before finally grinding to a halt.

The video, which was posted on social media sites, then shows men leaping out and running back up the road.

It is not yet clear how many people were hurt in the crash but New York Daily News reports that at least six people were on the roof.

Hundreds of ‘team leaders’ working on aid projects earn at least £120,000 a year once the costs of their expenses, security and accommodation are taken into account, an investigation found.

Daily rates of between £800 and £1000 are commonplace, the Times newspaper claimed.

The revelations will return attention to Britain’s growing aid budget, which now accounts for some £12 billion of public spending a year.

The Coalition government committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid – and even passed legislation to enshrine the target into law.

That target means that aid spending will increase every year if the economy grows, even if other areas of government spending face swingeing cuts.

David Cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending while slashing funding for the police, defence and justice.

The details of consultant spending sparked outrage among backbench Tories who have opposed the aid target.

Philip Davies, who is Tory parliamentary candidate for Shipley said: ‘When people think of overseas aid they think of people who have aid their homes damaged by an earthquake, a hurricane or a tsunami. They don’t expect to be lining the pockets of consultant fat cats.

‘This is what happens when you are judged only by how much you are spending. How you actually spend the money becomes immaterial. It leads to grotesque waste and overspending.’

The Department for International Development said it uses private sector companies as well as charities to deliver aid projects if they were the best placed to do the job.

But officials insisted that spending on external consultants giving advice to the department had fallen.

A spokesman said: ‘DfID has slashed spending on external consultancy and advisory services by 98.9 per cent since 2009, down to just £200,000 last year, but we rightly continue to use the private sector where it delivers aid projects on the ground that are effective and the best value for money.’

The Times quoted anonymous ‘insiders’ claiming that private firms were making huge profits of 50 per cent on aid projects.

A report in January by the National Audit Office found civil servants at the department went on a £1billion spending spree over eight weeks to hit the government target.

Money was spent at the end of last year on humanitarian programmes but MPs questioned whether the rate of spending meant it achieved value for money.

The coalition aid commitment – meant Dfid was required to spent some £11.46 billion in 2013..

But in June that year officials realised they would have to spend another £2.7billion in November and December to hit the target.

Months later that target was revised up again by another £1billion over those two months, taking the total to £3.7billion.

The NAO report said the burst of spending that raised concerns the money was not used wisely.

It said: “Given the limited time available the department could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013. It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending.”

The latest celebrity beauty craze is having a tight jawline like Emma Stone . Getting a Nefertiti Lift , or lower face rejuvenation has become a must have in Hollywood . Dr Barbara Kubicka sees a host of celebrities at her Knightsbridge clinic . She has clients coming in each and every day asking for Botox .
-----------------------------------------------
I really enjoy celeb watching. For me it's all about watching the parade of stunning women wearing dresses that I would neither be able to fit into nor afford.

As I get older however, different things draw my attention. A clear sign that I'm firmly settled in middle age may be the utterly sad truth that, I am riveted by the tight jaw lines. 

And on a recent trip to the U.S. it seemed that I am not the only one. I spent my time there scouring the faces of the women - and men - that I met, trying to spot a wobby chin or weak lower cheek.

As a matter of fact I couldn't find a single jowl on anyone. These women had expression lines, wrinkles around their eyes and on their forehead when speaking, but chins and jaw lines that were as tight as a girl just sitting her GCSE's. 

Scroll down for video 

Forget botox or chemical peels the latest celebrity beauty craze is having a tight jawline like Emma Stone 

And I'm not just talking about 20-something's like Emma Stone or Margot Robie, but even amongst the over 40's, and the 50-somethings, there wasn't a slackened jowl in sight. It's not just about being thin, there's tightness that on planet earth, as far as I can tell, just shouldn't naturally be there.

So just how do they do it?

As a 40-something woman who is sadly observing a jaw line that appears to be more and more desperate to rendez-vous with my neck each and every day – it has become my latest obsession.

After some calls to my best insider A-list Docs, it seems the new trend in celebrity-ville these days is not about hiding your wrinkles, instead it's the Nefertiti lift, aptly named after the Egyptian queen famous for (amongst other things) her very defined jaw line.

Dr Barbara Kubicka says she has clients coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line.

Dr Barbara Kubicka sees a host of celebrities at her Knightsbridge clinic and says that 'While the whole world expects it's wrinkles that age you, it's actually your face shape that's making you look older.' 

She has clients coming in each and every day asking for Botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line.

Here's why: 'The first thing that our mind assesses when it come to judging the age of the person is shape of their face,' Dr Kubicka says, 'Our faces change with time from a triangle (high cheek bones and defined jaw line) to a square with a heavy jaw line and double chin. 

The shape of the face is much more important than the lines and folds. In fact, according to recent research we universally recognise as younger, a person who is wrinkly but has a youthful face shape. 

Thus, traditional Botox on the forehead alone doesn't improve appearance, but changing the shape of your face and tightening your jaw line, does.' Getting a Nefertiti Lift, or lower face rejuvenation has become a must have in Hollywood right now, and you can understand why. 

Ashley says the latest anti aging treatment is the Nefertiti lift for jowls 

Think about the love scenes. How many of us can say with confidence we don't have double chins when lying down? I dread to think what mine looks like. And these actresses are filmed that way and just as badly – from the side whist talking. How I dread those photos showing up on Facebook!

Indeed, for those of us who live our lives 'off camera' or shall we say with less pressing incentive than our celebrity friends have, there's still a feeling of wanting to look the way we used to. 

The good news is though, that apart from a lower face lift – which lets be honest plenty of actresses have – for those of us who want to avoid going under the knife there is a lot of other stuff out there we can do.

Indeed, Dr Kubicka of ClinicBe confirms that there's a lot that can be done without surgery:

You can jab it: Access to soft and fat tissue around the jaw line and under the chin can be corrected with up to 3 sessions of Aqualyx (which is a new and improved version of 'flab jab') It works to dissolve fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate. 550 pounds per treatment. 

You can tighten it: Loss of skin laxity can be rectified with different skin treatments like Dermaroller, Radio Frequency or laser and loss of volume on the upper face resulting in a lower face drop can be improved with Dermal Filler or Sculptra. 

You can lift it: Over active Platysma muscle on the neck that pulls the corner of the jawline down with every contraction can be relaxed with muscle relaxant injections such as Botox which gives an effective lift. 

Botox (muscle relaxing injections): Nefertiti Lift £350 (Treatments last 3 - 4 months) And finally Dr Kubicka says that the best innovation over the last couple of years is threads. These have been around for a while (remember Madonna was snapped with that suspicious scarring that was widely believed to be a thread lift?)

Brand new to the market are PDO threads - a Korean innovation that is suitable for both lifting and tightening. It's far less invasive than traditional threads (there is no hook to hook them on) and there are many sizes and lengths of threads available which allows treatment to every part of the face and even the body. 

As much as they lift they result in an increase of collagen production and line improvement as a bonus. PDO Threads - Price on Consultation. (Treatments last up to 18 months) And with all of these treatments, subtlety is what you're aiming for. 

Says Dr Kubicka: 'The greatest advantage is that we can improve the lower face, lift it and tighten without adding extra volume (as seen before with the dreaded 'pillow faces look') which allows us to achieve not only a younger but as well more naturally beautiful facial appearance.'

Sufferers usually do n't live to see their teenage years and die from pneumonia . Mrs Barden has made arrangements for both daughters ` funerals with her husband , Luke , 28 .
-----------------------------------------------
Most mothers dream of their children's birthdays, graduations and weddings.

But Jodie Barden has the heartbreaking task of arranging both her daughters' funerals, knowing that neither will make adulthood because of an incredibly rare illness.

Mrs Barden, 28, is mother to eight-year-old Ella and one-year-old Chloe, who both suffer from Cockayne Syndrome and have a life expectancy of just 12.

Cockayne Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, which is characterised by a failure to gain weight, premature ageing, an underdeveloped nervous system and a small head.

Scroll down for video 

Jodie Barden, 28, has been forced to plan her daughters Ella, eight (left) and Chloe, one (right)'s funerals as they have rare genetic disorder Cockayne Syndrome which gives them a life expectancy of just 12

In 2013, Mrs Barden shaved her head in order to raise money for a Cockayne Syndrome charity. She is pictured here with daughter Ella, who ages prematurely due to the syndrome

Sufferers usually don't live to see their teenage years and usually die from pneumonia.

Given her children's prognosis, Mrs Barden has already made arrangements for both daughters' funerals with her husband, Luke, who is also 28.

The former graphic designer, who is now the girls' full-time carer, said: 'There's no cure for what they have and there's not much the doctors can say, so we just try and keep them comfortable while they're with us.

'They'll eventually lose their sight and hearing and, when that time comes, we want to be able to provide them with somewhere where they can still have fun.'

The condition causes premature ageing, so despite the fact the girls are seven years apart, they look like they are a similar age. 

Ella currently has a tremor, which makes drinking from a beaker difficult, and she only says words like 'yes' and 'juice'.

Chloe isn't walking yet and probably won't ever reach this milestone.

But while they cannot speak, Mrs Barden said they do not fail to communicate their desires through gesturing.  

She said: 'They are both such good fun - real cheeky monkeys.' 

She describes the moment she was told her children had the disease as 'devastating'.

Cockayne syndrome (CS) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies as well as rapid aging (a form of progeria).

People with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, and they have an 'aged' look.

It is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose.

For CS patients who are affected at birth, life expectancy is 3–7 years.

Other patients only start to show symptoms in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years.

However, some rare CS patients live significantly longer.

Individuals with CS are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours.

CS is often described as a 'progeria-like syndrome'.

Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disease wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age.

One of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture occurred in the 1922 short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button by F. Scott Fitzgerald (and later released as a feature film in 2008 staring Brad Pitt).

The main character, Benjamin Button, is born as a seventy-year-old man and ages backwards; a scenario inspired by progeria. 

She said: 'Ella was diagnosed at Great Ormond Street in 2012 when we noticed she wasn't hitting her milestones; when she didn't start talking when we expected her to.

'I was pregnant with Chloe at the time and that's when we found out she would be born with the same disease.

'It was devastating, but once we got over the shock we decided we would do all that we could to make their lives memorable.'

The disease is inherited and Mrs Barden and her husband, a HGV driver, both carry the mutated gene.

They have a one-in-four chance of conceiving a child with Cockayne Syndrome, whereas the odds are usually two in a million.

Now, she and her husband are trying to make the most of the time they have with their daughters, as well as their four-year-old son Alex, who does not suffer from the disease.

Mrs Barden said her son is 'fantastic' with his sisters.

She said: 'He's genuinely loving and has a very caring nature.

'If either of the girls drops something on the floor he will just pick it up without being asked.

'We will always be honest with him.

'The girls are always happy and never moan, they keep smiling despite everything they've been through.'

She added that her husband is incredibly supportive, and the whole extended family have helped them through a difficult time.

She said: 'It's a test of anyone's relationship, but luckily Luke and I have always been very close.

'We're also lucky to have support from both sides of the family.'

They have collectively raised around £14,000 for charity Amy and Friends, a Cockayne Syndrome charity based in Liverpool.

This was done through a series of events including skydiving and hosting coffee mornings.

Mrs Barden even shaved off her hair in January 2013.

And in the same year, Ella, who uses a wheelchair and walking frame to get around, appeared on a special episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show for Mother's Day.

Mrs Barden said the whole family is now trying to make the most of the time they have left with the girls. Her son, Alex, four, is 'fantastic' with his sisters, she said

The reality television presenter paid for her to dress up like a princess and climb the Eiffel Tower.

And last year, they flew to Melbourne and the Gold Coast in Australia where Ella swam with dolphins.

Mrs Barden said: 'We met up with another family with Cockayne Syndrome over Facebook.

Essex charity, Wipe Away Those Tears, is sending the family to Disneyland Paris for an Easter holiday.

In the meantime, Mrs Barden is taking on a Tough Mudder event in September.

Her ambition is to raise enough money to kit out a special sensory shed at their home in Witham, Essex.

She said: 'The sensory shed is basically just a big playhouse in the garden where they can interact with twinkly lights and feel different objects.'

-----------------------------------------------
Andrea Yates' ex-husband has condemned the criminal process the killer was put through 14 years after she drowned their five children in the bathtub of their suburban Texas home. 

Russell 'Rusty' Yates, who has since remarried and has a son, slammed his ex-wife's murder trial, claiming it was the 'cruelest thing he had ever witnessed'.

He insisted her actions were 'completely a result of her illness' and maintains she was a good mother who loved her children. 

The mother from Clear Lake, Texas, systematically drowned Noah, 7; John, 5; Paul, 3; Luke 2; and Mary, 6 months, in their home in June 2001. 

Andrea Yates' ex-husband Rusty (left), who has since remarried and has a five-year-old son, slammed her murder trial (pictured right in 2002) as the 'cruelest thing I have ever witnessed' 

The Yates' boys, from left: Paul, three, John, five, Noah, seven, and Luke, two, dressed up for Halloween the year before they were drowned in the bathtub by their mother

Six-months-old Mary Yates, killed by her mother along with her four older brothers. Andrea Yates was said to be suffering from postpartum depression when she drowned her children in 2001

She then called 911 and told the first officer to arrive at the scene that she had just killed her children.

Earlier that day she fed the children breakfast and said goodbye to her husband as he left for work. 

She was convicted of capital murder in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison, after prosecutors tried and failed to get the death penalty. 

But an appeals court granted her a retrial and in 2006 she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and moved to a mental health facility. 

Yates had been diagnosed with postpartum psychosis - the most severe and rarest form of postpartum depression.

Little was known about it at the time and most afflicted mothers were left to suffer in silence. 

Her condition was a cause of huge pain for Mr Lake, who has revealed he still cares for his wife and visits her - even though they divorced in 2005.  

Speaking on Oprah's Where Are They Now, Mr Yates said: 'This [was a] mentally ill woman -- who otherwise loves her children, was a great mother, was a great person -- and they're going to sit her in trial? Try to kill her?

The first trial, where prosecutors sought the death penalty, was hard on Mr Yates.

The Yates family portrait (before baby Mary was born), left, and husband Russell 'Rusty' Yates outside his home the day after his children were murdered. Almost 14 years after the deaths, he maintains his ex-wife was a good mother who loved her children 

Mr Yates married Laura Arnold, a woman he met at a church in Clear Lake, during a private ceremony in 2006, two days before his ex-wife's murder re-trial

He added: ''They spent a week showing pictures of our children's dead bodies in front of a jury, in front of her.

'I mean, from my perspective, that's the cruelest thing... She's somebody that needs love, compassion, support.

'They just take her and put her on public display, with the bodies of my children. It's so wrong.' 

The former nurse and stay-at-home mom had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts before the horrific incident, when she drowned her children, one by one, in the family bathtub.

According to investigators, Yates had to chase the last child, her eldest, Noah, seven, through the family home and drag him into the bathroom.

The former high school valedictorian's devastated husband, Rusty, remained married to his wife for four years after their children's deaths and he continues to visit her although they divorced in 2005.

He has now remarried and has a five-year-old son.

Of his former wife, he said in 2012: 'She is doing well, all things considered. She's been medically stable for five years.'

Andrea Yates was first convicted of murder but this was overturned on appeal in 2006. She was found not guilty by reason of insanity and has since been in a psychiatric hospital 

During her first trial in 2002, Yates lawyers claimed she believed that the devil was inside her and that by killing her children she would save them from hell.

Her attorney George Parnham and his wife, Mary, have campaigned for more awareness of women's mental health issues.

Nine years ago, he helped setup the Yates Children Memorial Fund to educate families about postpartum psychosis and similar conditions.

One out of 1,000 women are said to experience postpartum psychosis and may hear voices, see things and have thoughts of harming themselves or their baby. 

Last year, doctors recommended that she be granted permission to attend group outings from the psychiatric hospital where she has been institutionalized since 2006.

She is the only patient at Kerrville State Hospital who has never received a group-outing pass, said Parnham.

A decision is set to be made on it this year. 

Mr Yates married Laura Arnold, a woman he met at a church in Clear Lake, during a private ceremony in 2006, two days before his ex-wife's murder re-trial. The pair began dating shortly after his divorce was final. 

In 2008 his new wife gave birth to a son

Police chief says shooting does not have apparent connection to terrorism . Unidentified male walked through a public area and shot himself , police say . Authorities treated the shooting as suspicious packages , prompting the lockdown . The lockdown was lifted about 3 : 50 p . m . ET .
-----------------------------------------------
Washington (CNN)A shooting that prompted the lockdown of the U.S. Capitol for several hours Saturday was a suicide and does not have an apparent connection to terrorism, Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said in a news conference.

An unidentified male walked through a public area on the west front of the Capitol early Saturday afternoon and shot himself, Dine told reporters. Witnesses told CNN dozens of shocked onlookers watched, including some young children.

The unidentified shooter had a backpack and a rolling suitcase that authorities treated as treated suspicious packages, prompting the lockdown as they were investigated, Capitol police said.

The male carried a sign with a message about "social justice," authorities said. A witness, Robert Bishop, told CNN it also said something about taxing the "1%."

Dine said there was "no nexus to terrorism" apparent so far in this incident.

The building and the nearby Capitol Visitors Center were locked down, meaning tourists or any staff could not enter or leave the buildings.

The Capitol area was crowded with tourists taking in the Cherry Blossom trees, which are in full bloom along the National Mall.

Members of the Capitol police force, which responded to the scene, did not fire their weapons, Dine said.

After the suspicious packages were examined, the lockdown was lifted about 3:50 p.m. ET and pedestrian traffic was allowed.

Responding to the incident were the Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the death, as well as the FBI, Secret Service and Park Police.

Many tourists at the scene were filming at the time and showed their photos and video to investigating law enforcement officers.

CNN's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.

-----------------------------------------------
The Florida mailman who caused a major security scare when he landed his gyro-copter on the US Capitol lawn on Wednesday afternoon was just seconds from being shot out of the sky.

House Homeland Security panel Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that Capitol authorities had Doug Hughes, 61, in their sights and were prepared to open fire.

'Had it gotten any closer to the speaker's balcony they have long guns to take it down, but it didn't. It landed right in front,' McCaul said about the flight which was undetected until authorities actually saw the craft approach.

However, Hughes claims he informed the Secret Service and Capitol police of his potentially lethal stunt into the no-fly zone, which was designed to draw attention to campaign finance reform and government corruption.

Speaking prior to the flight and just days after a man shot himself dead in front of the Capitol on Saturday causing panic, Hughes appeared confident he would survive his 'insane' protest.

'I don't believe that the authorities are going to shoot down a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle,' said Hughes of the latest embarrassment for White House and Capitol security.

Indeed, NORAD reported that they did not scramble any assets and were not informed of the flight until it had landed.

And local Washington D.C. response helicopter units designed to deal with slow moving targets admitted they did not react either.

Doug Hughes' close friend Mike Shanahan, said today that the Hughes is not a terrorist and did not mean any harm with his protest.

'I was scared to death they were going to kill him,' Shanahan said to the Tampa Bay Times. 'My thanks goes out to whomever it was who decided not to pull the trigger.'

The mailman's flight to raise awareness for campaign finance reform and donation caps caused the Capitol to go into lockdown as stunned members of the public watched him land his single-seat gyro-copter around 2pm and breach the No-Fly 'P56-Zone'.

'He has no weapons or anything else,' said Michael Shanahan to CNN. 'I know him personally. He's like a pitbull when he has an idea. He wants to wake up the country.' 

Hughes, who has been planning his 'insane' D.C. flight for two years was promptly arrested by police and FBI teams moved in quickly afterwards with bomb disposal robots.

Capitol Police didn't immediately identify the pilot or comment on his motive, but a Florida postal carrier named Doug Hughes took responsibility for the stunt on a website where he said he was delivering letters to all 535 members of Congress in order to draw attention to campaign finance corruption.

'As I have informed the authorities, I have no violent inclinations or intent,' Hughes wrote on his website, thedemocracyclub.org. 

'An ultralight aircraft poses no major physical threat - it may present a political threat to graft. I hope so. There's no need to worry - I'm just delivering the mail.'

Embarrassment: A gyro copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol is seen on the west front lawn in Washington

Witnesses said the craft approached the Capitol from the west, flying low over the National Mall and the Capitol reflecting pool across the street from the building. It barely cleared a row of trees and a statue of Gen. Ulysses Grant.

John Jewell, 72, a tourist from Statesville, North Carolina, said the craft landed hard and bounced. An officer was already there with a gun drawn. 'He didn't get out until police officers told him to get out. He had his hands up'' and was quickly led away by the police, Jewell said. 'They snatched him pretty fast.'

Elizabeth Bevins, a tourist from Atlanta, said she was standing across the street from the Capitol when the helicopter flew in around 20 or 30 feet high, and it 'just sort of plopped down on the lawn.'

Downtown Washington is blanketed by restrictions on air traffic that generally prohibit aircraft from flying over the White House, the Capitol, the national Mall and key buildings without special permission.

The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot hadn't notified it of his plans to enter restricted airspace. 

The situation was under investigation and streets in the area were shut down. Emergency vehicles were dispatched to the area and a robot bomb detector was sent over to the craft.

Amid the commotion, the small craft presented a strange sight sitting on the green lawn of the Capitol, its rotors slowly spinning.  

Landed: The gyro-copter sits on the West Lawn after it came to a halt having defied the no-fly zone over the US Capitol and White House

According to the Tampa Bay Times, 61-year-old Doug Hughes has been planning the stunt for two years saying, 'No sane person would do what I'm doing.' 

In a report published by the newspaper prior to this afternoon's unauthorized landing, Hughes said, 'I have got a plane, a gyro-plane. And I'm going to fly it, I'm going to violate the no-fly zone, non-violently,' he says in the video posted to the newspapers website. 

'I'm going to land on the Capitol Mall.'

Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times prior to his flight, Hughes said that he had phoned the Secret Service to tell them he would land in front of the Capitol and that he had emailed Barack Obama's public email too.

He said that he flight would serve as a protest against rampant lobby and interest groups controlling the political process and a wake-up call for security.

'Again, I'm going to fly low and slow and these guys are going to have a full head of adrenaline. Eventually, I'm hoping the Blackhawk will catch up with me about the time that the authorities realize that I'm not a threat and knocking me down is not a politically savvy move, and I anticipate having an escort all the way in. I'm hoping for a friendly escort.'

Retrieval: People walk past the gyro-copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday

While he got no escort and the authorities were not aware of his incoming flight, Hughes is aware of what the consequences will now be.

He anticipates losing his job with the US Postal Service and expects to lose his freedom.

He admits to not telling his Russian-born wife or his four living children for fear they would be implicated.

At the bottom line of his protest is his belief that money has corrupted democracy.

'We're heading full-throttle toward a breakdown,' he said to the Tampa Bay Times. 

'There's no question that we need government, but we don't have to accept that it's a corrupt government that sells out to the highest bidder. We can have a government that works for the people, that answers to the people, that can only take money from the people in small amounts.' 

Hughes became politically radicalized two-and-a-half years ago when his 24-year-old son from a previous marriage committed suicide by driving his car head-on into another car - killing the driver.

Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times, Hughes says that 'something changed in me' and that he realized he had to commit to making a change in this world.

He hit upon his daring gyro-copter plan and set up a website and began to email every TV station and newspaper he could.

He also told the Secret Service. Indeed, Hughes claims an agent came to see him last spring to ask him about his stunt and left him his card.

Before he set off today, Hughes told the Times, 'I have thought about walking away from this whole thing because it's crazy,' he said. 'But I have also thought about being 80 years old and watching the collapse of this country and thinking that I had an idea once that might have arrested the fall and I didn't do it.

'And I will tell you completely honestly: I'd rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall.'

Talking to MailOnline, Jordan said: 'I wanted to propose for a while now but wanted it to be somewhere extra special where there would be hundreds of people in the same area – plus somewhere she couldn't escape. 

'After the marathon I met my fiancee and family at the mall and cuddled and celebrated a little bit until my legs turned to rock and I had to lay on the floor. 

'Our anniversary is on April 29, so proposing so close to the day and in front of my family and hers was daunting but also amazing – my happiest day so far.'

After sealing the deal with a kiss and a cuddle, Jordan rejoins the pack of runners and carries on with the race

Jordan was running the race to help raise funds for the Salvation Army, who provide accommodation for homeless people.

According to his Just Giving page, Jordan had excelled his target of £1,500 by raising £1,760.37 in funds from a total of 88 donations.

Koby Hodder, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed in the school playground when he was 10

A 10-year-old boy nearly died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the school playground.

Koby Hodder's heart stopped for a staggering 12 minutes after he collapsed while running around with friends during the morning break.

He was playing British Bulldog – a game in which children run from one side of a playing field to another without being caught by one of the ‘bulldogs’, who often employ forceful tactics to trap runners, including rugby tackling opponents to the ground.

Teachers across the country have called for the game to be banned, claiming it is dangerous and leads to children becoming injured.

In the middle of playing the game, Koby suffered a cardiac arrest.

This is where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or ‘fibrillates’ instead.

His heart suddenly stopped beating blood around his body and he collapsed and lost consciousness.

The 10-year-old was later diagnosed with the same heart condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba, a former Bolton Wanderers  player who collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham in 2012.

Mr Muamba was 'effectively dead' for 78 minutes and had to be shocked 15 times before his heart restarted. 

Teachers at Koby’s school in Doncaster, were able to give Koby CPR until paramedics arrived and saved his life.

His father, Mark, 45, got a call from the school at around 11am on March 2, and was told to get to the school immediately.

He said: 'I was working around the corner so I was able to get straight over there and when I saw Koby on the ground I knew he was dead.

'Teachers were giving him CPR but I could see he was grey and lifeless. I couldn't even go to him. I was devastated.'

Luckily he was brought back to life when paramedics Lee Murphy and Martin Parkinson and emergency care assistant Freddie Stevens arrived, and were able to save him by giving Koby two shocks with a defibrillator.

A cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping blood around your body. 

The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF).

Ventricular fibrillation happens when the electrical activity of your heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead.  

Someone who is having a cardiac arrest will suddenly lose consciousness and will stop breathing or stop breathing normally. 

Unless immediately treated by CPR this always leads to death within minutes.

It is possible to survive and recover from a cardiac arrest, with the right treatment. 

Ventrivular fibrillation - which causes an arrest - can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall, by using a device called a defibrillator.

Koby, who turned 11 two weeks ago, was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where he seemed to be making a recovery.

Just as he seemed to be improving, he suffered another attack, and was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary Paediatric Intensive Care Unit.

Mr Hodder, a builder and father-of-three, said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry. 

'Koby is super-fit, he plays football three times a week and goes boxing two times a week.

‘How could this happen in someone so young?’

Koby’s mother, Joanne Hodder, 43, added: 'Can you imagine what we were going through? 

'We didn't even have a clue what had happened to Koby.

‘We didn't think for a moment that he could have had a heart problem.

'I had dropped him off to school that morning and he was his happy little self.

‘We had no warning. Koby is a bit of a joker so when he collapsed even his friends thought he was messing around, until they noticed he wasn't breathing.'

While Koby was in hospital doctors fitted him with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to shock his heart back into rhythm should it ever stop again.

Muamba, 26, was fitted with the same implant after his high profile collapse three years ago.

Mr Hodder said: 'At the moment we don't know what has caused Koby to have a heart problem. It is baffling.'

Koby had a device fitted to his heart which will shock it back into beating if it ever stops again. He is pictured in hospital with boxer Josh Warrington

Mr and Mrs Hodder are due to have tests to see if Koby's heart condition is hereditary.

His brother and sister, Joel, 27, and Courteney, 20, may also have to be tested.

Mrs Hodder, said: 'I cannot thank each and every person who played a part in saving Koby's life and helped with his recovery, enough.

'Teachers, paramedics and hospital staff have all been amazing.

'As a parent it is your worst nightmare to receive a phone call like I did from school, when you sent your healthy 10-year-old child there fit and well that morning.

'Doctors have said that the fact that Koby was running around at the time of the attack may have helped him - because it meant his heart was pumping.'

Koby knows he is lucky to be alive, but his dream of being a professional footballer has been taken from him.

Koby had played with both Leeds United and Doncaster Rovers youth teams and dreamed of playing for his beloved Leeds United when he got older.

Mr Hodder said: 'Doctors have said he can play with friends as long as he doesn't exert himself too much.

‘They've said that if he can exercise and talk at the same time then that's okay, but playing professionally is out of the question.

Koby suffered from the same heart condition as Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton Wanderers football player who collapsed after a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham

'Maybe Koby would not have been a professional footballer but he is gutted, understandably.'

Mrs Hodder said: 'When Koby feels down we tell him that he is very lucky to be here and that makes him feel better.

'But he is still recovering and sometimes he feels scared, but he is still getting used to his defibrillator. It's a big thing he has had to deal with.

'For his birthday he didn't want a sleepover as we had originally planned, instead we went for a day out to York.

'Koby has come a long way and even returned to school this month.

'He's had a fantastic recovery so far, which is all down to the fast response from the school staff and the paramedics.

'He's doing better than we could have ever imagined. I am so grateful we still have our little boy with us.'

Steven Allison , 37 , had been on the run from the law for a year . He was convicted of sexually assaulting two women in Leeds in 2013 . But he failed to appear in court and fled to Australia , where he found work . He posted pictures of his new life and boasted about his carefree bachelor lifestyle .

-----------------------------------------------
A sex offender who tried to evade justice by fleeing to Australia has been caught after police tracked him down through his boastful Facebook posts.

Steven Allison, 37, formerly of Idle near Bradford, West Yorkshire, had been uploading pictures of himself looking tanned and happy as he enjoyed his freedom in his new life Down Under.

But he was unaware the net was closing in as British police teamed up with colleagues in Australia and Interpol to locate Allison, who was living in the country's capital, Canberra.

Steven Allison (left) was uploading pictures of himself in Australia to Facebook and writing posts about his former life in Yorkshire (right) despite being on the running from the law

Allison had already been on the run for a year when he was given a 30 month jail sentence for sexually assaulting two women after failing to turn up at Bradford Crown Court in February last year.

He was supposed to be lying low in Sydney, where he found work as a labourer and handyman, but couldn't resist showing off his new life to his 739 Facebook friends.

The sex attacker, who goes by 'Stig' on Facebook, posted pictures of his former life in Yorkshire and boasted about his carefree bachelor lifestyle, saying he wanted to meet women.

Allison even joked about days being drunk in his hometown, including posts such as 'fooocking leathered that day,, for a change haha [sic]'.

He also posted pictures of himself in his t-shirt on a building site with his arms raised in a mocking salute to Facebook friends, many of whom had no idea about his criminal past. 

The assaults happened in June 2013 when Allison had been out drinking with a friend in Yeadon, Leeds, where he approached two women who rejected his advances. 

Allison would not take no for an answer and indecently assaulted one of his victims as she left the pub in disgust.

He had been laying low in Sydney (pictured) before moving to Canberra, where authorities closed in on him

When her friend threw a drink over him the rugby fan snapped and punched both girls to the ground.

A West Yorkshire force spokesman said Allison had been charged with two sexual assaults but failed to appear in court.

He added: 'Enquiries made by Bradford District's Public Protection Unit and Interpol traced him to Australia, where he had been working on construction sites.

'He was located in January this year and subsequently held in a detention centre, while arrangements were made for him to be returned to the UK.'

While being held, Allison made one last bid for freedom by feigning an arm injury so he could attempt to escape while being taken for medical treatment.

But his plan failed and he was brought back to the UK yesterday in handcuffs and flanked by three security guards from Australia.

Det Insp Ben McDonald, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'It was clear that Allison felt he could cheat justice by fleeing the country and escaping to Australia.

'He fled to the other side of the world to escape justice. However, the police will always pursue those wanted for serious crimes such as this, regardless of where they are in the world.'

He is expected to appear in court before being transferred to prison.

"She had eaten a lot of cake for her birthday last March 5. "

"However, in the last 10 days she stopped eating. I think eating was her motivation to live, and when she lost it, she passed away."

The Leicester fixture was chosen by Astle's widow Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire because he made his West Brom debut against The Foxes 50 years ago.

West Brom supporters regularly applaud in the ninth minute of games at The Hawthorns, marking the number Astle wore on his shirt.

A Judge who fell asleep while a child abuse victim gave evidence and caused the trial to collapse has been reprimanded by his bosses

The part-time judge, Recorder Philip Cattan, 65, from Cheshire was seen to fall asleep during the rape trial of John Quingley at Manchester Crown Court last summer.

A retrial had to be ordered and with the child having to give evidence for a second time, the Daily Mirror reported.

While the jury was out of the room, the judge was confronted with the claim that he had slept through part of the cross-examination of the witness, who was giving evidence via videolink because of her age.

The incident was witnessed by the family of the victim in the trial of John Quigley, which was expected to last five days

The girl giving evidence was the first of two young girls expected to testify that they were abused in offences spanning from 2006 to 2013.

The body that regulates the judiciary, the Judicial Conduct Investigations office has rapped the Manchester recorder over the incident.

The Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice were quoted as saying they found evidence of serious misconduct following complaints that Cattan gave the appearance of falling asleep.

The cost of the abandoned trial and the retrial is believed to have cost the taxpayer £10,000.

The defendant, Quingley, 49, of Benchill Manchester was found guilty of child sex charges and jailed for 14 years.

Leading criminal barrister, Kama Melly, who specialises in child sex crime, told the Daily Mirror, when the trial was suspended, that it is always devastating for a victim to have a trial delayed so long while an investigation takes place.

Cattan’s role as recorder means he sits for up to thirty days a year as a judge and he has previously. He has overseen cases on gangland murders, the Oldham riots and major drugs cases.

Judge Gabriel Hutton, a former senior judge at Gloucester Crown Court, fell asleep during the trial of Lee Woodward, who was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl on a riverbank in Sharpness, Gloucestershire.

He was granted bail and a retrial was demanded where he was cleared.

Judge Hutton, now retired, was ordered to apologise for the incident.

Mass brawl broke out at Fat Tuesdays bar opening at Resorts World Casino . Two women allegedly got into an argument during the long wait for drinks . Security guards and a police officer were injured in the brawl . The damage from the fight is thought to top $ 4,000 .
-----------------------------------------------
The mass brawl which broke out at a bar opening inside a Queens casino Friday night was allegedly caused by an argument in an enormous line for drinks.

Hundreds of patrons hoping for an iced daiquiri at the debut of a Fat Tuesdays bar inside the Resort World Casino ended up at each other's throats when the party went sour.

According to a casino worker, the fighting goes back to two women who clashed during the long wait for alcohol, dragging their group of friends into the conflict.

The fisticuffs escalated, with guests grabbing chairs and poles to bring to the fray, as security guards rushed in to try to calm the brawlers down.

Bystanders uploaded cell phone footage of the ugly brawl, which broke out around 10.30pm, to social media. Running gangs of fighters can be seen storming through the halls of the casino, shouting profanities at one another.

A witness, Elize Brown, told CBS2 New York: 'It was chairs flying everywhere — it was chaotic.

'It was nerve-wracking. It was like you don't know what the next thing that was going to happen was.'

According to the New York Post, three men were arrested in the aftermath of the brawl, which injured four security guards and a police officer.

Andrew Rivers and Jovan Bovell, both 23, were charged with disorderly conduct.

Bovell was also charged with resisting arrest, while Marcus Stewart, 30, was issued two summonses for disorderly conduct.

Several of those involved were taken to hospital to be treated for their injuries. Ambulances were pictured gathered outside the scene of the fight late Friday night.

Resorts World pledged to increase security and work with police to prevent a second round.

A spokesman said: 'There is absolutely no room for this kind of behavior at our facility'.

The damage from the fight is thought to top $4,000.

-----------------------------------------------
It has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of Saigon as the North Vietnamese army descended upon the city, and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety.

Ba Van Nguyen was able to fly a CH-47 Chinook, the largest helicopter in the South Vietnamese army, with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the South China Sea where they were all ultimately saved by the USS Kirk.

This after Nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own.

Histo4ric: Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter (above) on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975

Saved: He flew towards the USS Kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land, and so he hoovered over as his family (daughter circled in red) safely jumped out

Helping hand: Sailors on the ship caught the family (above) as they jumped out

In an interview with CNN, some members of the family are revealing what happened on that historic day, and their lives in the years after.

They were also part of the PBS special, The Last Days of Vietnam. 

On April 29, 1975, Nguyen moved his family to his mother-in-law's house, telling them he would be back the next day in the Chinook, and that they would hear him coming when he was close.

'If you hear a Chinook coming, get ready,' Nguyen told his wife. 

When he arrived later that morning, his family and a few friends got on - as gunfire from the communist forces grew louder and louder as they came closer to the city - and flew out towards the water.

Shortly after however, they realized they were running low on fuel, and that is when Nguyen reached out to the Kirk asking for permission to land.

'I must land or crash into the sea,' Nguyen said. 

'Please help us.' 

Bravery: Nguyen then flew back out to sea (above) and jumped from the helicopter

Safe: He managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel (above) when the plan crashed

Heading back: A motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea (above) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers

The Kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter, which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard. 

And so it was decided that Nguyen would at least try and save his family.

He hoovered over the ship as every passenger jumped onto the deck and were caught by sailors, including his wife and three young children.

That is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone, get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere.

Seconds later, he appeared in the water, wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and a shirt.

Hos one possession, some gold he had in his pocket, had fell out and sunk in the South China Sea. 

'We couldn't figure out how he did it; he was a Houdini,' said Hugh Doyle, the chief engineering officer. 

A motorboat was sent out to retrieve him, and moments later he was reunited with his family. 

The Nguyen family would be part of the 30,000 South Vietnamese refugees ultimately rescued by the Kirk.

'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk. 

Unbelievable: Nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it's intricate system (above) alone after everyone jumped 

Over: 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk of Nguyen's (above) feat

That was just the beginning for Nguyen though, who now had to start over in America and try to support his family.

He did not know the language and he had no money, but he was able to eventually land a job as a technician at Boeing in Seattle.

According to his children he was strict, but also self-sufficient and proud, getting the family off government assistance after just a few months and encouraging hard work above all else.

'Your mother and I came to the United States with nothing but my drawers,' he would tell his children. 

'Look at where we are today. We are not wealthy. But we are not poor.'

He was reunited with the crew from the USS Kirk in 2009, finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years, and awarded an air medal for bravery.

'He was staring at me and I was staring at him. He knew and I just knew,' said Chipman of the emotional reunion, this despite the fact that Nguyen was already in the throes of Alzheimer's. 

It was then that his children were able to see just what their father had accomplished as footage of the day was shared by some of the men who had filmed the incident.

Then, three years later, following a remarkable life, Nguyen passed away.

He was 73-years-old.

The Brazilian man shot dead alongside Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Indonesia was a paranoid schizophrenic who didn't realise he was being executed until his last moments of life.

Rodrigo Gularte, 42, asked 'Am I being executed?' as he was being chained up to be transported to the jungle clearing on Nusakambangan island where he and seven other death row inmates were killed by firing squad in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

The Irish priest appointed to be Gularte's spiritual advisor in his final hours said he talked to Gularte for an hour and a half late on Tuesday night to prepare him for the executions, but the convicted drug trafficker was confused about his fate and complained about hearing voices.

'When they took him out of the cell I was with him and he went to the front place, just to go out to where the car was, and then they put these bloody chains on them,' Father Charlie Burrows told Irish radio station RTE.

'And he said to me "Am I being executed?"

'And I said "Yes, I thought I was explaining that to you".

'And he didn't get excited because he was a very quiet kind of a guy but he said "This is not right."'

Father Burrows said Gularte then became paranoid that he would be shot while he was in the car.

'Because he's schizophrenic he said "Oh, there's a sniper waiting outside to shoot to me" and I said "No, you're safe now."'

Father Burrows said once they arrived at the killing fields, all eight death row inmates were tied to crosses with cable ties.

All eight men refused to wear blindfolds, choosing instead to face their executioners.

Father Burrows said once the men were tied up he was allowed to go and speak to Gularte again, who did not become hysterical but spoke in protest of his imminent death.

'I talked to him and he said "This is not right, I made one small mistake and I shouldn't be having to die for it,"' he said.

'He was annoyed more than anything else because he's a very soft spoken, quiet and sensitive man.'

Gularte was arrested in 2004 on arrival at Jakarta airport with about six kilograms (13 pounds) of cocaine hidden in several surfboards. 

He was sentenced to death by the Tangerang District Court in February 2005, and spent seven of his 11 years in prison on Nusakambangan.

Gularte's family tried without success to obtain clemency for him, saying doctors have classed him as paranoid schizophrenic.

Under Indonesian law, a mental health disease can provide for clemency in death penalty cases.

Jakarta twice turned down appeals for clemency and the Indonesian authorities told the Gularte family only a government doctor's diagnosis would be considered for Rodrigo's possible reprieve.

Gularte's devastated family always insisted he was mentally ill and fell prey to drugs in his teens and to a Brazilian drug cartel in his early thirties.

He was so deluded that when he was arrested he told Indonesian police his two fellow couriers had nothing to do with the scheme. They were sent home. A year later, he was sentenced to death.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia in February, when Gularte's family still had hope he might be spared, his cousin Marlise Gularte de Cavalho said the 42-year-old would tell his family he didn't believe that he would be executed during prison visits.

He insisted a manned satellite over Nusakambangan was stalking him and voices in his head told him he wouldn't be executed because 'the voices say the death penalty has been abolished'.

'For the two hours we are there I guess he would talk lucidly for about 10 minutes,' Ms de Cavalho told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms de Cavalho spent weeks with Gularte's other cousin, Angelita Muxfeldt, and his mother Clarisse Muxfeldt taking the police ferry almost daily to visit Nusakambangan where he was held island's newest prison, Pasir Putih, which lies not far from one of its famed white sand beaches. 

Angelita tried for years to make Rodrigo aware of the danger he was in, but afflicted by delusions he would tell her it 'was all a trick'.

'Now I don't tell him because he is calm and not frightened. Perhaps it is better that way.'

 Nusakambangan Island where Rodrigo Gularte was held for the past seven years on death row

Rodrigo Gularte's family hired a government professor of psychiatry to examine Rodrigo in prison on Nusakambangan. The prison governor sent the professor's written diagnosis of Gularte's schizophrenia to the Indonesian Attorney General, but it was rejected

'They say no,' said Ms de Cavalho, 'they won't listen, the president has the power over people's lives that should only be God's'

-----------------------------------------------
Embarrassing footage has emerged of a missile launch going spectacularly wrong in Russia.

The minute-long clip shows the S300 rocket barely managing to take off before plummeting back down to earth.

A small thud can be heard and bits of debris fly off as the weapon makes a feeble attempt to launch at the military base in an unknown part of Russia. 

Lift off: The rocket just about launches with debris and a plume of smoke clearly visible next to the Russian flag

Up and down: The S300 rocket barely manages to take off before it starts plummeting back down to earth

It scarcely gets off the launchpad and is followed by a small plume of smoke, before it can be seen dropping out of the sky as shouts can be heard from those watching.

Seconds later, the rocket goes out of view as whoever is filming takes cover and a huge explosion can be heard.

The shaky camera returns to a massive plume of smoke.

The leaked footage will be of some embarrassment to Vladimir Putin who as grown the Russian defence budget has grown by 33 per cent to £54billion over the past year. 

It comes not long after shocking footage emerged of failed another rocket launch which killed six Russian ballistic missile technicians. 

Bang: A loud explosion can be heard before plumes of smoke are clearly visible following the failed launch of a rocket in Russia

Footage of the accident, which happened several months ago but officials tried to keep quiet, was posted on social network sites.

It happened near Donetsk in the Ukraine where it is believed the missile was about to be fired against government forces.

A second OTR-21 Tochka missile was successfully launched a few seconds later from the wreckage, but there is nothing left of the launch site controlled by Russian backed militia. 

It shows a deafening explosion in a field with plumes of white smoke rising quickly into the atmosphere.

A second missile, which would also have been programmed, is still launched from the wreckage a few seconds later, presumably heading towards its intended target.

ISIS uses Abu Ghraib and other cases of Western abuse to legitimize its actions in Iraq . U.S. poured money into Iraq after 2003 invasion , but did not make support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources . Lack of accountability in aftermath of American intervention in Iraq paved the way for abuses .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)The jailing of four Blackwater security guards, eight years after they killed 17 Iraqi civilians in a shooting in Baghdad, is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough.

The kind of horror represented by the Blackwater case and others like it -- from Abu Ghraib to the massacre at Haditha to CIA waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the West these days, but it is being used by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to support its sectarian narrative.

In its propaganda, ISIS has been using Abu Ghraib and other cases of Western abuse to legitimize its current actions in Iraq as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant "Sunni resistance" to "American aggression" and to "Shiite betrayal"—as phrased in an ISIS publication from late 2014 titled "The Revived Caliphate," which chronicles the rise of ISIS since 2003.

As the Iraqi government today struggles to regain the support of Sunnis in its fight against ISIS -- or even renew intra-Sunni trust -- this invocation of American transgressions by ISIS should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in Iraq.

The lack of accountability in the aftermath of the American intervention in Iraq not only paved the way for abuses like Abu Ghraib and Blackwater, it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country -- and today ISIS is reaping the benefits.

The U.S. poured money into Iraq after the 2003 invasion, but it did not make this support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources by the Iraqi government. This enabled the Shiite-dominated government of former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to discriminate against the Sunni community.

The United States was also sloppy in relying on private security firms like Blackwater without implementing rigorous measures to regulate their behavior. It also turned a blind eye to the way its own troops were treating Iraqis. All those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by ISIS to push its own version of Iraqi history.

In "The Revived Caliphate," Abu Ghraib is invoked three times as the place where Iraqi Sunnis who resisted the U.S. ended up as a result of their betrayal by Shiites who collaborated with the Americans.

The publication first recounts attacks on Abu Ghraib at the height of the American intervention by al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI)  -- ISIS' predecessor -- to free imprisoned "Sunnis" who had been detained by the Americans.

It then presents the Sahwa (Awakening) of 2007 -- when Sunni tribes collaborated with the U.S. to fight AQI -- as a case of intra-Sunni resentment that led the tribes to hand over AQI members "to the Americans, where they were put through severe torture in the likes of the prisons of Abu Ghraib," according to the publication.

It then links those two stories to the storming of the prison by ISIS in 2013 to free those who had been tortured by "the Americans and Shi'a" (as the publication puts it) over ten years. In bridging a decade of history and in placing the Shiites squarely in the category of "enemy," ISIS is sending a strong message that its current fight in Iraq is about reversing longstanding injustices against Sunnis and restoring a sense of Sunni belonging under the umbrella of the "caliphate."

The civilians killed by the Blackwater guards, like the Abu Ghraib prisoners, were both Sunni and Shiite. But the repackaging of history by ISIS -- in which the Saddam Hussein regime is reinvented as a "Sunni" regime that tried to stand up to the United States and its Shiite allies -- glosses over those nuances.

The reproduced images of Abu Ghraib prisoners in the aforementioned ISIS publication, juxtaposed with images of civilian deaths as a result of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets, are presented as "proof" of the group's narrative. And they are reinforced with text that frames America today as "the air force of the Shi'a."

It is becoming clear that ISIS cannot be defeated in Iraq without buy-in from the country's Sunnis. Without Sunni help, ISIS will continue to frame the conflict as one where Sunnis are once again being attacked by the U.S. and the Shiites -- particularly as Shiite militias have become a key part of the fight against the terror group in places like Tikrit.

To balance out this Shiite involvement, the U.S. and Iraqi governments are counting on the establishment of a cross-sectarian Iraqi national guard, and hoping to resurrect the "awakening" to re-engage and unify the Sunnis under a nationalist umbrella.

But those plans will not succeed unless serious steps are taken to ensure that good governance measures are in place to hold both Iraqis and all those affiliated with the anti-ISIS coalition to account.

This should not just apply in the context of the current conflict -- so that scenarios like Abu Ghraib and Blackwater are not repeated -- but also when the dust settles. Good governance is the most effective antidote to sectarianism.

A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h)

Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track.

This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service.

Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains.

And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys.

Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds.

But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future.

The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway.

The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail.

The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027.

According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half.

For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h).

The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time.

Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964

It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes.

Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century.

The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr).

It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China.

The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027

China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service.

The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build.

Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities.

But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe.

Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe.

'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said.

'It's a very difficult system to make operational.'

A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher.

Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University.

The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains.

'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

Aaron Cresswell is a reported target for Chelsea and Manchester City . But West Ham boss Sam Allardyce claims no offer has been made . The 25-year-old has been a consistent performer for the Hammers this season . Cress well made 32 Premier League appearances and scored twice .
-----------------------------------------------
West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has claimed no club has made an offer for Aaron Cresswell, and that the left back would be better off continuing his development at West Ham amid rumoured interest from Chelsea and Manchester City.

Cresswell, 25, has been a consistent performer for the Hammers since signing from Ipswich for £2million last summer, making 32 Premier League appearances and scoring twice in his debut top-flight season.

The defender’s performances have not gone un-noticed among the division’s top sides, with Chelsea and Manchester City supposedly eyeing a deal for Cresswell in the summer. But Allarydce claims that club have not been approached with an offer for his services.

The 25-year-old has starred for the Hammers this term, scoring twice - including this goal against Newcastle

‘As far as I am concerned, no-one has bid for Aaron Cresswell. So, it’s all pure rumours and speculation, which has to fill the huge amount of media space that you have to fill,’ Allardyce said.

‘My problem is: does it affect Aaron Cresswell and affect his performance?

‘Players can lose that focus on that rumour and that’s for me to make sure Aaron does what he can all season and he performs on a consistent basis. What will happen in the summer, we will wait and see.

‘I have even heard somebody said we have put a £25m buyout on him. That’s the first I know, I haven’t heard anything from myself or through owners to say “well, if somebody wants AC they would have to pay 25m.”’

Despite Cresswell’s smooth negotiation of the step up to the Premier League from the Championship, Allardyce firmly believes he would be better served staying with the east London side next season.

‘There’s no doubt about that, because he’s year one in the Premier League. Year one is an ongoing experience that you have that you know the level,’ Allardyce continued. 

‘Aaron now needs to grow from that experience. His challenge is to continue to work as harder than he has this year, not to rest on his laurels, to think that he’s here.

‘We have seen players do that and then year two more of a disaster than his impressive first year. His professionalism will come into play start of next year by where he gets and if he gets to the next level.

-----------------------------------------------
A young Irish rugby star escaped serious injury when his home was targeted by a gunman who fired multiple bullets through his windows.

Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s and recently played in their Six Nations campaign, was not at his home in Cromkill in County Antrim, Northern Ireland when it was targeted on Easter Sunday.

Shocked neighbours said he could have been killed if he was in the property, after bullets tore through the windows and ended up embedded in the kitchen and bathroom walls.

Mr McBurney, who lives at the home with his brother Shane, 20, and is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby, is said to have returned to the house following the attack but is yet to speak about the incident.

Photographs from the scene today show at least 12 bullet holes still visible in a living room window of the property, which is situated on a small housing estate alongside just seven other homes.

Police Service of Northern Ireland said a number of shots were fired at the windows of the unoccupied house at 2.20am on Sunday.

Detectives are now appealing for witnesses and said the incident had 'criminal elements'.

Officers also said a red Honda Accord car, which is believed to have been involved in the incident, was found burnt-out in a nearby road shortly after the attack.

Chief inspector Natalie Wilson said: 'This type of attack is totally unacceptable and there is no place for this type of activity in a civilised society. I know that the vast majority of people in Ballymena do not support those responsible.

'I want to reassure the Ballymena community that we are determined to tackle these criminal elements and as such we are committing additional resources over the next few nights.

'We will not accept this type of behaviour and I would ask for community support and information as we work to identify those responsible.'

Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident which occurred when the house was unoccupied in the early hours of Easter Sunday. Investigators' markings showed at least 12 bullets hit one window of the house

Mr McBurney, who lives at the home on a quiet residental street in County Antrim with his brother Shane, 20, is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby and played in Ireland U20's game vs France U20's (pictured above)

One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as 'very worrying'.

He told Belfast Live: 'It is fortunate the boys were not at home when these shots were fired into the living room because with that amount of shots flying about we very well could be talking about the death of one or two brothers, one of whom is one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland.'

Adam McBurney is deemed one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland and there are hopes he will play internationally.

The young player grew up playing for his local club Ballymena, and has also been associated with Randalstown RFC.

He has since gone on to represent Ulster and Ireland and has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s – playing recently against Italy and France in their Six Nations campaign.

He is also actively involved with the Belfast Met Rugby Academy- which blends intense professional rugby training with academic courses.

Alongside rugby, McBurney works at Tullyglass House Hotel - an imposing country residence set in its own grounds on the outskirts of Ballymena.

Another neighbour, Marie McKeown, 77, added: 'I heard the bangs and at first I didn't realise what it was. It woke me up. 

'This is a very quiet area. I would be a light sleeper and I heard bang, bang, bang. I was shocked when I heard this happening. I hope it quietens down.'

Following the attack, police cordoned off part of the housing estate and increased patrols in the area.

It is believed, from the bullet casings found at the scene, that a nine-mm type weapon was fired with twelve rounds hitting the living room window and its frame. A further two strike marks were visible on the wall above the window.

Bullets lodged in the kitchen and in the bathroom walls suggest that anyone who might have been in either room at the time of the shooting would most likely have been killed or suffered serious injury.

Mr McBurney, who played for his local rugby club Ballymena before going on to represent Ulster and Ireland, inherited the property with his brother when their mother Heather died in December 2013.

Anyone with information about the incident should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Catholic News Service in America slams ` anti-Catholic point of view ' Criticises depiction of Sir Thomas More as ` sleazy , mean-spirited and just plain rude ' US media looking forward to ` great British import ' starring Damian Lewis . Washington Post reviewer warns distortion of facts points to ` ideological bias '
-----------------------------------------------
Catholic bishops in America have denounced Wolf Hall as a ‘prejudice-laden presentation of the past’ as the acclaimed BBC drama was broadcast in the U.S. for the first time.

The review attacked the six-part series as ‘a work of fiction that adopts a narrow, revisionist and anti-Catholic point of view toward the religious turmoil of the Tudor period in which it’s set’.

The latest remarks echo criticisms voiced by clergy in the UK, who tore into the series for its 'perverse' depictions of the historical characters when it first aired.

Bishops in the USA have slammed Wolf Hall, starring Damian Lewis, after it was broadcast for the first time 

The audience is encouraged to support 'monster' Thomas Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance in the hit series, a damning review by the Catholic News Service in America said after the first episode was aired in the USA

The review also slates the depiction of Catholic martyr Sir Thomas More, played by Anton Lesser in the show as an 'evidence-flouting caricature' that is 'sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude'

A review for Catholic News Service, an agency of the U.S. Bishops’ Conference said that the show encourages the audience to ‘root for the self-made commoner Thomas Cromwell’ when in fact he was a ‘monster’ who engineered a reign of terror and murdered anyone who stood in his way.

In contrast, the drama’s depiction of Sir Thomas More, a Catholic martyr, is ‘not a pretty sight’, said author Joseph McAleer.

‘The future saint is barely recognisable: sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude,’ he writes. ‘This evidence-flouting caricature is light-years away from the man of principle.’

A Washington Post reviewer warned the distortion of historical facts in Wolf Hall pointed to 'ideological bias'

US media were generally looking forward to the historical drama being shows on Masterpiece PBS as a 'great British import', with Homeland star Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII and Claire Foy playing Anne Boleyn

Gregory Wolfe said that the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's book 'could obscure important lessons'

The criticism from the U.S. Catholic Church follows that of Mark Davies and Mark O’Toole, the Catholic Bishops of Shrewsbury and Plymouth, who said Wolf Hall was guilty of ‘anti-Catholic’ depictions of More, played by Anton Lesser, and for its whitewashing of Cromwell, the hero of the drama, played by Mark Rylance.

Most U.S. media looked forward, however, to the opening episode of the series, broadcast on Masterpiece PBS last night, as a great British import co-starring Damien Lewis, the anti-hero Brody in the U.S. series Homeland, playing King Henry VIII.

One of the few critical reviews of the adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s historical novel appeared in the highly-influential Washington Post, however, which warned viewers that the distortion of the facts pointed to a ‘clear ideological bias’.

‘What makes for great drama may not make for good history,’ said the review by Gregory Wolfe.

‘Mantel’s version could obscure important lessons from that dark period that have continuing relevance for the present moment,’ he added.

Wolf Hall was BBC2’s most popular drama since 2002 , gaining an average of 4.4million viewers during its six-week run.

-----------------------------------------------
After years of hoping he would rip opposition defences to shreds, Pep Guardiola has admitted he has to start trying to work out a way to stop Lionel Messi.

On the prospect of facing the greatest player in Barcelona's history, Guardiola – the greatest coach the club has had – said: 'We will have to see what we can do in each of the two games and we will try to create the best defensive system possible to stop Messi.

'They are a wonderful team but so are we,' said the Bayern Munich boss.

Guardiola goes back to Barcelona with the team now coached by Luis Enrique playing their best football since he left the club in 2012.

'It will be a very special game for me,' he said after the teams were drawn to face each other.

'It will also be special for Thiago [Alcantara] and for the rest of the coaching staff. I lived my whole life in Barcelona, it' s my home.'

Guardiola nurtured Messi into the best player in the world while manager at the Nou Camp

Guardiola showed how much the club still means to him when alongside his father he watched them beat Manchester City in the last 16, cheering them on from the stands of the Nou  Camp.

He did little to hide his appreciation for Messi that night and admitted that the four-times Ballon d'Or winner could punish Bayern if they are as sloppy as they were in the first leg against Porto in the quarter-finals. They went down 3-1 before hammering the Portuguese outfit 6-1 in Bavaria.

He said: 'If we make the same mistakes then the tie will be all over in Barcelona.'

-----------------------------------------------
Jurgen Klopp rejected the overtures of West Ham United after handing in his notice at Borussia Dortmund. No matter, it was worth a try. Now on to the next one.

If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year's time. West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. 

Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost.

The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom.

If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom.

Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival.

Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project

The 34-year-old also allegedly told a contact that some Football Conference teams would ` do ' a game in return for payment .
-----------------------------------------------
A former Premier League striker urged a footballer at a struggling non-league club to make some 'easy money' by fixing the result of a match, a court has heard.

Ex-Bolton Wanderers forward Delroy Facey, 34, is also alleged to have told a contact that some Football Conference teams would 'do' a game in return for payment.

Facey, whose former clubs include Hull City and West Bromwich Albion, is accused of conspiring with non-league player Moses Swaibu and others to commit bribery.

On the second day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, prosecutor Nick Mather claimed records of online messages showed Facey had approached footballers about 'throwing' lower league matches.

In one text conversation, conducted on messaging service WhatsApp in late 2013, Facey is alleged to have tried to corrupt Greater Manchester-based Hyde FC player Scott Spencer by offering him £2,000.

The court heard that Facey, of Huddersfield, made contact with Mr Spencer shortly after discussing Hyde's poor run of form with a convicted match-fixer.

Mr Spencer, who the court heard was not involved in any form of match-fixing, is alleged to have been messaged by Facey, who told him: 'You lot (Hyde) get rinsed out, week in, week out.

'You lot should make some money out of this lad, easy money.

'Check this out. Four goals in a game - two in either half - and you guys can get 2k each, win lose or draw.

'You guys can't win for s*** so you may as well make some peas.'

During the WhatsApp conversation, which was read to jurors by Mr Mather, Facey is alleged to have added that a friend who was betting would provide the cash.

Addressing the jury on the second day of his opening speech, Mr Mather claimed Facey was attempting to bribe Mr Spencer and team-mates that he trusted into fixing a match.

Mr Mather further alleged that Facey told a convicted match-fixer in another message: 'I have got (Football) Conference teams that will 'do' a game but how much?'

Transcripts of messages which passed between Facey and 43-year-old Krishna Ganeshan, who was found guilty of conspiracy at an earlier trial, were also shown to the jury.

In an exchange on October 28 2013, the court heard, Ganeshan used Skype to contact Facey, telling him: 'Get ready, things are about to come to life. Keep your boys on stand-by.

'If they deliver first time, me and only you are in big business for the future.'

The Crown claims the Skype discussion - and a message sent by Facey claiming six players in the Football Conference were 'amenable' to match-fixing - could not have been part of an attempt to rip off a gambling syndicate.

Mr Mather told the jury: 'It may be suggested to you that what Delroy Facey was actually up to was trying to scam people who were betting on football matches.

'The prosecution say that is not the case.'

Facey and Swaibu, 25, of Bermondsey, south London, deny conspiring together and with others to commit bribery between November 1 and 27 2013.

Dr Christopher Valentine (pictured) used his iPod to take illicit photos of patients, a tribunal heard

A doctor who was allowed to continue working after taking intimate photographs of patients has been caught doing it again, it emerged yesterday.

Dr Christopher Valentine, 52, was sacked from a sexual health clinic and hauled before the General Medical Council nine years ago for photographing half-naked male and female patients without consent.

His behaviour was branded ‘inappropriate’ but he was not struck off and went to work at an NHS service for drug addicts and alcoholics.

However, the married doctor has been caught again after a nurse saw images of a semi-naked man on his iPod Touch during a night out. 

Fiona White was stunned to find the pictures while looking at others he had taken of colleagues at a a leaving do.

Valentine told her the image – which appeared to be of a man’s genitals – was of a patient’s heroin injection site, but Miss White and another nurse who saw it were suspicious and decided to report him to his boss. 

Yesterday, the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal in Manchester heard that Miss White saw the pictures on the iPod in April 2013 at a leaving party for a member of Clydebank Community Addiction Team, a unit led by Valentine that treats addicts near Glasgow.

Giving evidence at the fitness-to-practise hearing, Miss White said: ‘He started taking photographs around the table and I asked to have a look at them. 

He handed me the device and I scrolled through and saw photos of people at the table and came across a photo of his cat.

‘I kept going and came across a photo of what I would describe as a male groin. I didn’t look close but I remember getting such a shock.’ 

Miss White gasped at the image, prompting her colleague Maria Forrester, who was sitting next to her, to look at the iPod, too.

Mrs Forrester, a senior addiction nurse, said: ‘In the blink of an eye I could see what she had reacted to. It looked like it was a part of a male body. She seemed quite startled.

A nurse was swiping through photographs of Dr Valentine's pets when she came across an image of a semi-naked man, a tribunal

‘I remember Dr Valentine saying these were pictures of injection sites. I think I did see genitals.’

Mrs Forrester said she met Miss White later to discuss their concerns, adding: ‘There was a consensus that both of us had seen a naked image of part of a male’s body. 

'I was concerned that patients were being photographed without consent. I thought I had to report this. 

'I couldn’t think of any reason why that doctor would have pictures of patients’ groins.’

Valentine told his boss he took the photos for teaching purposes and used his iPod because he was unable to use NHS equipment.

The fitness to practice hearing took place at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (pictured) in Manchester

But an investigation found he used the device to take 53 photos, some of vulnerable patients of both sexes. Some were stored on his home computer. More than half had been deleted when the iPod was seized and had to be retrieved by IT specialists.

Valentine, of Dunoon, west Scotland, admitted ten allegations of taking photographs without medical reason or consent and showing them to colleagues. He denied lying to his boss about how many he had taken and keeping them on his device until August 2013. The hearing continues.

`` Amy : The Girl Behind the Name '' is set for UK release on July 3 . The teaser features early footage of Winehouse talking about her music career . Winehouse struggled publicly with drugs and alcohol during her career . A U.S. . release date for the film has yet to be announced .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)The first trailer for a documentary on the life and music of late British singer Amy Winehouse was released Thursday.

The teaser for "Amy: The Girl Behind the Name," set for UK release on July 3, features early footage of Winehouse talking about how her music career was born and where she believed she was headed.

"Singing has always been important to me, but I never thought, 'I'll end up singing' or 'I'll be a singer,' " Winehouse said.

"I felt like I had nothing new that was coming out at the time that really represented me or the way I felt, so, you know, I just started writing."

Winehouse, known for her bluesy voice, bouffant hairdo and numerous tattoos, struggled publicly with drugs and alcohol during a career in which she recorded two albums and won six Grammys (one posthumous). She died from alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on July 23, 2011.

Her biggest hit, "Rehab," chronicled the efforts of those around her to get her to submit to substance abuse treatment.

"Amy" seeks to "truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn't get a chance to know," the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013.

Amy Winehouse documentary gets UK release date

The trailer conveys Winehouse's ambivalence about fame. "I'm not a girl trying to be a star or trying to be anything other than a musician," she says.

"I don't think I'm gonna be at all famous," Winehouse tells an interviewer early in her career. "I don't think I could handle it. I would probably go mad. Do you know what I mean? I would go mad."

A life cut short: Remembering the tragedy of Amy Winehouse

Unlike an earlier look at the singer's life, 2013's "Fallen Star," the documentary has been endorsed by Winehouse's family. It will feature "extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks," Deadline reported.

The team behind the new film includes Asif Kapadia, director of the documentary "Senna," on the life of Brazilian Formula 1 racer Ayrton Senna. The film won two BAFTA awards.

"The award-winning producers of Senna presented a vision that would look at Amy's story sensitively, honestly and without sensationalising her," the family statement said. "We want this to be a tribute to her musical legacy."'

A U.S. release date for the film has yet to be announced.

CNN's Michael Pearson contributed to this report.

Germans now think of themselves as the victims of Hitler and his Nazi Regime

Germans no longer see the Second World War as a defeat and now think of themselves as victims of the Nazis, it has been claimed.

Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation.

Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade.

Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported.

The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin.

Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared.

'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper.

'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.'

Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes.

The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement.

The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader.

German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.'

Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling.

'Celta played well for the whole 90 minutes, but there are games that are won on little details,' the centre-back told the club's official website.

'However, the most important thing is getting the three points.'

The Frenchman praised his defensive partner Gerard Pique for his impressive display against a tough opposition.  

'Playing with Pique is very simple,' he added. 'He is outstanding - it is amazing to play with him.'

When asked  who would his vote be for MVP this year by ESPN, James replied 'myself', before adding: 'Guys are going to be able to recognise the guys they play against every night and what they do for their franchises.'

James may be trailing New Orleans' Anthony Davis and Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook, but has impressed on his return to Cleveland.

In the four years that he was playing for Miami Heat, the Cavs won 19, 21, 24 and 33 games; they have already won 51 games this season, and secured the Central Division title and No 2 seed in the Eastern Conference by defeating Milwaukee. 

James scored 21 points with nine rebounds and eight assists for the Cavs in their 104-99 victory against the Bucks, including 10 points in the fourth quarter. 

Cleveland Cavaliers have secured the Central Division title and will be No 2 seed in the Eastern Conference

-----------------------------------------------
A 3-year-old's recurring nightmare about a mysterious white van may help shed light on what really happened the day her mother died in an SUV crash that Virginia police have ruled a tragic accident.

Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, a married mother of three from Chesterfield County, was returning home from a birthday party February 21 with her daughter, Elisa, in the backseat when she supposedly slid off a rain-soaked road, slammed her silver Ford Explorer into a tree and died at the scene.

Investigators concluded that the crash was a one-car collision that was caused by poor road conditions.

Loss: Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, pictured with her husband, Craig, and their two children, was killed in an SUV crash in Virginia two months ago to the day 

Deadly impact: Castellanos-Tyler was just a few miles from her home when her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree

Accident: Police said the crash was a one-car collision caused by a rain-soaked road 

Elisa Tyler emerged from the accident largely unscathed, but according to her father, Craig Tyler, the little girl has been plagued by disturbing nightmares and daytime visions about the accident.

'She’ll just start walking and she’ll start screaming, "The van, the white van!”' the young widower told CBS6.

'I’ll say, "What happened with the white van?" And she says, "It hurt me — it hurt my car!”'

Tyler, who is now raising his their children, ages 9, 3 and 1, on his own after his wife's passing, at first did not know what to make of Elisa's night terrors.

But then this past weekend he came across several Facebook posts from nearby communities of Foxcroft and Magnolia Green about a series of hit-and-run accidents involving a white box truck.

One Facebook user, 17-year-old Caitlyn Thomas, claimed she was side-swiped by a white delivery-style truck on Otterdale Road March 30; the impact of the collision reportedly sent a piece of her side-view mirror crashing through the driver's window.

Doubt: Little Elisa, pictured left with her parents and baby brother, and right with her mom, has been having nightmares and daytime visions about a white van, which her father believes may have something to do with the crash 

Widower: Craig Tyler says the toddler, pictured above, has told him that the white van in her dreams 'hurt' her and her car 

Sightings: A plain white delivery-style box truck, possibly similar to the one pictured above, has been linked to no fewer than three hit-and-run incidents in which two cars and a school bus were side-swiped 

According to an eyewitness, the driver of the truck briefly slowed down and turned his head back to look at Thomas' damaged car, but then took off from the scene without waiting for police to arrive.

A day earlier, Subastree Thompson said she was also side-swiped by a white box truck on the same road.

According to the woman, who was driving with her 3-year-old in the backseat, the white van was carrying two or three men sitting in a single row. The van slowed down for a moment but then sped off before Thompson had a chance to take down its license plate number.

Then on April 3, a plain white van matching the same description as in the two earlier incidents allegedly side-swiped a school bus filled with students from Cosby High School.

Chesterfield County Police said they were investigating a possible connection between the crashes, but a spokesperson for the department said there was no evidence in Castellano-Tyler's collision to suggest the involvement of another vehicle.

Dashing duo: Natali, a native of El Salvador, and Craig met by chance at a restaurant several years ago and married in a courthouse in 2013 

The 30-year-old leaves behind three children, including a 9-year-old boy from a previous relationship in El Salvador and her and Craig's two kids, ages 1 and 3 

Tragic twist: The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July and Natali had picked out an ivory lace dress (pictured) for the big day. Instead, she was laid to rest in her dream gown 

The woman was just a few miles from her home when at 2pm her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree, reported the station WRIC.

Paramedics arrived on the scene but it was too late for the mother. Her daughter Elisa was taken to a hospital with minor scrapes and bruises.

On Monday, nearly two months to the day after the crash, Natali’s husband, Craig, wrote on his Facebook page that he was praying ‘for the truth to be revealed.’

He and Natali, a native of El Salvador, met years earlier at a local restaurant and married with little fanfare in a courthouse on June 21, 2012.

The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July, followed by a long-awaited honeymoon.

Natali had an ivory lace gown picked out for the big day, but instead of wearing it to go down the aisle, she was laid to rest in her dream dress February 27 in the presence of her heartbroken family. 

A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover some of the Tyler family's living expenses. So far, more than $15,440 has been raised.

The teenager who was famously pictured in a bloodied state in his mugshot after he sexually abused an 11-year-old boy and was beaten unconscious by the child's father has been jailed for 25 years.

Raymond Frolander, 18, was beaten to a pulp by the furious father after he walked in on the teenager performing a sexual act on his son at his home in Daytona Beach, Florida, last July.

After Frolander's arrest, police released his mugshot, which saw him sporting swollen lips and eyes, black bruises and lacerations to his face. The photo was quickly shared thousands of times online.

Now, the defendant has been sentenced to a quarter of a century in prison by Circuit Judge Leah Case after pleading no contest to lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim younger than 12.

Bloodied: After Frolander's arrest, police released his mugshot, which saw him sporting swollen lips and eyes, black bruises and lacerations to his face. The photo (above) was quickly shared thousands of times online

Wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, Frolander showed little emotion as he agreed to a plea deal in a bid to avoid a mandatory life sentence on Thursday,  the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported.

Speaking outside court, the child's 35-year-old father - who is not being named to protect the identity of the victim - said the sentence would give his son's attacker the chance to reflect on his actions.

'He’s going to learn in the next 25 years why I let him live,' he told reporters, according to WFTV. 

The youngster's grandmother added that the plea deal means her grandson will not have to go through the psychological trauma of a trial, saying: 'He just needs to learn to trust again.'

As part of the deal, Frolander, who had been molesting the boy for years, will be listed as a sexual predator, be on sex offender probation and undergo electronic monitoring for life after his release.

On the night of the attack, the child was apparently playing video games with Frolander and some friends. However, after the others left, the defendant took him to a back room, the boy told police.

Locked up: The youngster's grandmother said the plea deal means her grandson will not have to go through the psychological trauma of a trial. Above, Frolander is pictured being led away from the courtroom Thursday

There, Frolander reportedly pulled down the child's pants and performed a sex act on him, before being caught by the boy's father, who had just returned home after picking up some food.

The father, who had heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, pushed open the door and discovered Frolander with his genitals exposed, police said. He immediately started beating him.

In the early hours of July 18,  the father called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I just walked in on a grown man molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a bloody puddle for you right now, officer.'

He continued: 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' before adding: 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.'

Police arrived at the house to find Frolander unconscious. During an interview, the boy told officers the suspect had been molesting him for three years - something Frolander later admitted to.

Sex offender: As part of the deal, Frolander (pictured), who had been molesting the boy for years, will be listed as a sexual predator, be on sex offender probation and undergo electronic monitoring for life after his release

Bruised: The defendant is pictured during his first court appearance, still sporting injuries from the beating

After his arrest, Frolander was was treated at hospital before being taken to the closest police station. In his mug shot, his still-swollen face was evident from the beating he had received. 

Officers appeared to understand the father's reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said.

Speaking to WFTS, he added: 'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.' 

Days after the incident, the father admitted that it was only his son's pleas which had stopped him from killing the pervert after he had stormed into the kitchen and grabbed a knife in his rage.

'My son is the one who stepped in front of me and stopped me. My son saved his attackers life, so who's really the hero in this situation?' he asked WKMG after Frolander's first court appearance in Volusia County.

The man admitted he had 'just snapped' when he walked in on Frolander naked with his son. Shortly after beating the teenager into a coma, he  grabbed the knife and walked over to him, he said.

'I was going to kill him,' he admitted, adding that he and his family had considered Frolander a close friend and had often allowed him to spend time with the 11-year-old boy at their home.

'There was nothing uncommon to let the kids go in the bedroom and play video games together and now I have to wonder why the door was shut,' the father explained last July.

Sexual assault: Officers appeared to understand the father's reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. Above, the father is pictured with his 11-year-old son (left) before the attack, and Frolander is seen in a previous mug shot (right)

He added that his rage also stemmed from being molested himself as a child at a foster home in California. He said beating Frolander was the easy part and that much harder days lay ahead.

'I'm not going to pressure anything on [my son],' the father told reporters. 'I know exactly what he's going through, when he's ready to talk about it, he will.'

Police defended his actions but later criticized him for creating a Gofundme page, initially entitled 'Rebuilding Innocence' and featuring an image of a sleeping boy, asking for $1million in donations.

On the page, the father wrote: 'We are reaching out to anyone that can help. Our son was sexualy (sic) assaulted and we are now faced with the challenge of picking up the pieces, the emotional and financial burden is about more than we can endure.. Please.. Anything helps.'

Chf Chitwood told DailyMail.com he was 'pretty shocked' by the page, which was later taken down by the charity site.

'The police, investigators and prosecutors go to great lengths to protect victims of sexual abuse. I'm sure his intentions are in the right place but this is not good for the young man's recovery,' he said.

During his interview with police, the child reportedly told officers that he had been intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen to him if he revealed the abuse.

'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this,' Chf Chitwood said at the time.

No charges were filed against the boy's father.

'She always has security around. But in order for her to learn how to drive, she had to drive on her own. So once she was legally permitted to drive on her own, she gets in her car,' said Mrs. Obama.

Her eldest daughter's newfound freedom had reminded the first lady that not having dirven herself in seven years she had forgotten how to.

When Malia asked her mom about how to park in a public parking lot, the first last admitted she was stumped.

'I barely know now too so I have to check with other sources,' she said.

The first lady also discussed a Time magazine article which named Malia and sister Sasha among the 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014. 

'I don't know why — they're not influential, they just live here!' she joked. 'They have done nothing to gain any influence.'

'I don't think they even realize that they're influential,' she added. 'I don't think anybody showed them that article, so don't mention it!'

Tens of thousands of people gathered on the White House South Lawn on Monday for the annual Easter egg roll festivities. 

This year's theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama's campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives.

Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll.

The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling.

Festive: The First Family pictured outside Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, after Sunday's Easter service

President in the house: Obama can be seen to the right of the picture above worshiping on Sunday

The First Family has kicked off this year's Easter celebrations on Sunday with a visit to the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia.

Rev Howard-John Wesley had opened the service by welcoming the president, before urging the congregation not to take selfies with him. 

'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause.

'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' 

Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. 

The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering.

Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns

The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 

'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.'

Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins.

'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said.  

Appearing on Jimmy Fallon's talk show this week, the first lady revealed that she and her husband will be performing a routine with So You Think You Can Dance contestants on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll.

It will be to the tune of Uptown Funk.

Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year in the hope that it will inspire children to exercise. 

Well wishes: Michelle Obama tweeted this message to her thousands of followers on Sunday morning

Gorilla jumps toward exhibit window in Omaha , Nebraska . Kevin Cave caught the incident on video . `` It was n't as bad as we thought it was , '' zoo official says .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)A family trip to a Nebraska zoo turned terrifying for one family after the gorilla they were looking at leaped toward the exhibit window, cracking it.

Kevin Cave caught the incident on video that he posted on his Reddit page. It has already been viewed more than 1 million times.

Cave said when his family first arrived at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo gorilla exhibit, he noticed one of the gorillas had a cut below his eye that was "bleeding a little bit."

He said he overheard a couple of zookeepers say the gorillas had been fighting with one another.

Then the gorilla -- named Kijoto -- charged toward the window and smacked into it, he said.

The leap sent the family and other patrons running, but Cave said when he looked back, "it wasn't as bad as we thought it was."

Dan Cassidy with the Henry Doorly Zoo said he's been surprised by the attention since he considered the whole thing a "nonevent."

The group of male gorillas is known to have occasional skirmishes.

"They show how tough they are by pounding on the wall and the windows," Cassidy said.

Even with the crack, the public was never in danger, he said, because the window has multiple layers of both glass and acrylic.

Kijoto is a 20-year-old western lowland gorilla, according to a release on the zoo's website. He weighs 375 pounds.

But Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the kite could not be flown . Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters ` China Dream ' Professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the four-day-long festival .
-----------------------------------------------
As attempts to break a world record go, it was pretty impressive.

A Chinese team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6,000 metres (3.7 miles) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1,000 metres.

But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big, it posed a danger to passing aircraft.

The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south-western China, according to People's Daily Online.

Flying high: Half of the 6,000-metre-long dragon-themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday

Skilful: The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to manoeuvre

However, Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon-themed kite - which is made from 2,000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown, and the team were forced to fly only half of it. 

The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part, with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event. 

Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters 'China Dream' and it takes eight hours to get the full-length kite airborne. 

Wang Dongming, one of the three kite flyers, said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the  kite.

Mr Wang said: 'Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind.' 

In order to secure the pieces on the kite, craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind. 

Colourful: Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four-day-long festival

Although the kite did not fly full-length, organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world.

The previous record is reported to set by a 5,000m-long kite made by craftsmen in Weifang in eastern China last spring.

Professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the four-day-long Wulong International Kite Festival, including representatives from China, New Zealand, the UK and Italy.

The Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route opened to the public today . Over a million people visit the walls every year , but this dropped to 910,000 last year .
-----------------------------------------------
Nestled between a 65ft high snow cavern, the winding track of Murodo looks like track that could be on Mario Kart.

However this steep-walled phenomena is located in Japan and attracts visits from thousands of tourists annually - with the number predicted to rise this year.

The Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route opened to the public on today and allows tourists to view the spectacular snow-walled passageway along the 1000ft section.

Walled wonder! The Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route opened for visitors today, with tourists marvelling at the 65ft high walls

The Murodo-daira area of Tateyama unsurprisingly experiences one of the heaviest snowfalls in the world, with the 65ft walls being created every year, and then melting by July. 

The impressive route opened in 1971 and usually draws about a million visitors every year although numbers have failed to reach that figure in the last few years. 

An estimated 910,000 flock to the frozen passage last year.  

It is hoped the March 14 opening of the sightseeing route operator Hokuriku Shinkansen Line, which connects Toyama Station with Tokyo Station, will help to bump the numbers back up to the million mark. 

The snowy phenomenon can be seen on the winding track of Murodo in Japan from April under it melts in the summer

The whole 37km route will be open until November but tourists can walk the walled wonder until it starts to melt in summer. 

Sights along the way include scenic landmarks such as Kurobe Dam, hot springs and the Hida Mountains. 

One of the most popular activities is to ascend the 9891ft high summit of Mount Tateyama, one of Japan's highest peaks. 

Today tourists followed to photograph the walls. Over a million people visit the walls every year, although this dropped to 910,000 last year

It is hoped that numbers can rise again to reach one million with the help of the sightseeing route operator Hokuriku Shinkansen Line opening last month

The sun shone as coaches of tourists flocked today for the opening of the short section 

There are many views along the picturesque route include one of Japan's highest peak, the 9891ft high summit of Mount Tateyama

Snowy school trip! 200 Japanese schoolgirls climb the ascent to the top of Mount Tateyama. Other noteworthy sights along the alpine route include Kurobe Dam, hot springs and the Hida Mountains

-----------------------------------------------
A couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life-saving lung transplant. 

Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs.

As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help.

Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says.

Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story.

'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.'

Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago.

In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later.

The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says.

She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital.

She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has.

'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 

'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her.

'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.'

Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story'

Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate

Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done.

'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page.

In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. 

But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider.

'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services wrote in a statement to CNN. 

'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.'

However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients.

'UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation,' wrote spokeswoman Wendy Zellner.

So far, the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch

UPMC said they are want to help Katie but said it is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address the situation

While Katie seems to be caught in limbo, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency. 

Only three months away from their four year anniversary in July, the couple have not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received his lung transplant at UPMC. 

Even though he also had Cepacia like Katie, which makes lung transplants more complicated, his has been a success. 

However, he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection.

So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together.

'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.'

So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000.

-----------------------------------------------
Andrew O'Clee, 36, hid his secret second family from his first wife and has been jailed for eight months, pictured outside Chichester Crown Court yesterday

A bigamist was caught out when his first wife discovered his secret second marriage – on Facebook.

'Shameless liar' Andrew O'Clee, 36, wed Michelle Agbulos – and later tied the knot again with another woman.

But Michelle, 39, uncovered the deception when she came across footage of him completing the ice bucket charity challenge on the social networking site.

Serial cheat O'Clee had tried to cover his tracks by claiming he was involved in a fraud case and had been put into the witness protection programme which meant he had to live in a 'safe house' for long periods.

Blinded by her belief in his honesty, Michelle allowed herself to be taken in by his elaborate lies, agreeing not to tell her family and friends what was happening.

Yesterday the former soldier was jailed for eight months after a court heard about the web of 'lies and forgery' lasting four years.

O'Clee tied the knot with first wife Michelle in 2008. But while they were trying for a baby together, he had already started his double life with a new woman.

He later turned up at the birth of his daughter, Amelia, and cut the umbilical cord – before telling his wife he had to leave with a police escort.

But instead of heading to a so-called safe house, he would leave their rented flat in Ealing, West London to go back to finance manager Philippa Campbell in upmarket Chiddingfold, Surrey – a 40-mile journey away. 

He started the affair with Philippa after claiming his first marriage had ended after he caught shopworker Michelle being unfaithful. 

He married again in August 2013 – even forging divorce documents so his family would attend the second wedding.

O'Clee's lavish illegal nuptials took place in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, before the reception at Russets Country House, near their detached £575,000 home.

He began his affair with his second wife Philippa (right) in 2011 - while he and his first wife were trying for a baby, pictured together outside Chichester Crown Court yesterday 

His first wife Michelle (pictured) revealed that he showed up late at the birth of their child and said he had to leave with police

But the deception was uncovered last August when Michelle discovered a video of him on Facebook completing the ice bucket challenge – where people are filmed being drenched in freezing water for charity. 

It was captioned 'Uncle Andrew and Auntie Philippa'.

The post led her to photos of his second wedding, which she reported to police.

Yesterday O'Clee was jailed after admitting bigamy at Chichester Crown Court. 

But second wife Philippa, 30, has vowed to stay with him.

2000: Andrew O'Clee met Michelle

2008: The pair married in West Acton in 2008

2011: Couple began trying for a baby around the same time he started affair with Philippa

2012: O'Clee got engaged to Philippa and forged a decree absolute for his first marriage

2013: He married Philippa in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex

2014: Michelle and Andrew's daughter was born

2014: O'Clee was arrested in September

Judge Christopher Parker, QC, told O'Clee: 'You began to develop a complicated and absurd lie.

'All of which was a complete nonsense but it enabled you to lead a double life.

'Bigamy is an offence against the institution of marriage, an institution founded on complete trust. 

This was simply a selfish act.' 

To avoid detection, O'Clee told Michelle he had been placed in witness protection and had to live in a safe house as his life was in danger. 

She told the court: 'Thinking back, as I do every single minute of every single day, I had no reason not to trust Andrew. 

'I was told he would have to be taken to a safe house with his colleagues for his and my own safety.

'He was taken to a safe house every night and I wasn't allowed to know the location. 

'I was told by him not to tell my family or friends. I became paranoid and constantly fearful for my safety.

'Looking back I feel completely stupid and naive for not thinking something was wrong. I believed my life was in danger.'

Michelle went into labour 18 months after he began his safe-house lie.

The bigamist has since deleted his Facebook page and removed the incriminating Ice Bucket Challenge video

But O'Clee took five hours to turn up – and then cut the umbilical cord before saying he had to leave with police.

She added: 'The day I found out about the bigamy was the day my world fell apart and the violent betrayal unfolded. 

Bigamy is a crime under section 57 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. 

If someone is caught entering into another marriage whilst still being legally married and is convicted on indictment, they could face a fine or a jail term of up to seven years.

A custodial sentence can be ordered when one party has been deceived and suffered injury or if the offence has been committed for money to evade immigration.

'To add insult to injury he instructed me to take a paternity test.'

Defending, Patrick Duffy said O'Clee – who worked for business services provider ISS – has 'abandonment issues' because his parents split when he was 15. 

He said second wife Philippa planned to continue her relationship with him and wished 'to draw a line under this and get on with her life'. 

O'Clee admitted to one count of bigamy and is expected to serve half of his sentence in custody. 

Michelle is currently staying with her sister Jasmine Agbulus and her partner Sean in a house in Lancashire and refused to comment about her two-timing husband.

She used to live in a rented flat in Ealing, West London, with O'Clee and the landlord became so suspicious of his behaviour that he hired a private investigator to check on the pair.

O'Clee told Michelle he was in Witness Protection as his life was in danger and then moved into a new house in Chiddingfold, Surrey, (pictured) with Philippa 

His illegal wedding to Philippa took place in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, in 2013

The owners were alerted to the fact that nobody was living in the flat when neighbours complained about a foul smell coming from the property - which turned out to be rotting food in the fridge.

A spokesperson for the letting agents said: 'I'm glad that he's been caught out. We knew there was something strange going on.

'The fact he didn't want us speaking to his wife was very weird.

'We got in touch with Philippa and she said, 'Yes that's my husband' but she knew nothing about the flat.

'He called us and said, 'Don't speak to Philippa anymore it's a sensitive matter.' 

O'Clee cleared out all their belongings, including his old army uniforms, from the flat in October last year, according to the spokesman. 

Neighbours living at the block of flats in Ealing said they remember Michelle, as well as her 'energetic' husband.

One neighbour said: 'Yes I heard he had multiple wives. He was always on the go and very energetic.'

Another added: 'Michelle used to live here. She would always say hi when I saw her in the street. It's awful what he did to her.'

O'Clee and Philippa celebrated their wedding reception at Russets Country House, near their Surrey home

-----------------------------------------------
A historic SpaceX launch that could change the way man gets to space blasted off today from Florida under perfect conditions. 

Within minutes of liftoff, the California company  was making its third attempt to land the leftover booster on an ocean platform. 

But it didn't go to plan. Billionaire founder, Elon Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.'

Scroll down for video 

The booster appears to have landed but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over

SpaceX said it will post a video in the next few days, but images tweeted by Musk reveal that the booster landed successfully.

The impact of landing, however, caused it to tip over destroying the lower part of the rocket.  

Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. 

Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. 

Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs.

'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference.

Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year

The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean

While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning

The 208ft (63 metre) tall Falcon 9 rocket, carrying a Dragon capsule, thundered off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 4:10 p.m.

The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts.

The supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on Friday. 

The rocket was was due to take off yesterday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. 

On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy.

The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space.

SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville.

The Dragon - the only supply ship capable of returning items intact - will remain at the ISS until around May 21

At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment will arrive Friday

Soon after the launch, Elon Musk tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival'

Dragon, the SpaceX supply ship, holds more than 4,000 pounds of food, science experiments and equipment for the six space station astronauts

Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs.

First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink.

The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.'

The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21.

During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform.

A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. 

Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs 

The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand

On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy 

The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine.

Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated.

The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.'

Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw.

Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack.

The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding.

Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'.

As well as the espresso machine, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for Nasa's one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago.

Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016.

This will be the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral.

SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. 

As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit.

The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. 

The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. 

At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stands ready to boost a Dragon capsule on its fifth commercial resupply mission. This image was taken on Monday, before the attempt was scrubbed due to bad weather

This was Space X' third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge. Pictured is group's first attempt to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs. The attempt ended in fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion

Jennifer is a huge fitness fan, and the mother of two has completed triathlons

We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Jennifer Lopez's arms.

She's famous for her killer curves, but Jennifer Lopez's upper-body is as impeccably toned. 

A huge fitness fan, the mother of two has completed triathlons.

She avoids sugar and salt and tries to get eight hours' sleep a night. 

She claims 'sometimes when I get home and I'm not feeling so great, I make myself go to the gym'.

What to try: 

Modified push-ups with your knees on the floor aren't just a cop-out for the real thing, they activate the entire upper body to get that J-Lo tone.

Start on all fours with your hands on the floor, slightly wider apart than shoulder width. 

Slide your knees back and raise your feet off the floor until you are in a position where you can bend the elbows to drop your chest and push back up. 

Make sure you move the whole upper body, not just dipping your shoulders.

Repeat 12 to 15 times.

Diego Costa will miss four weeks with a hamstring injury, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has confirmed.

The Spain striker aggravated a hamstring problem in last weekend's win over Stoke.

Costa was already certain to miss the games against Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United but had hoped to return in time for the clash against Arsenal on April 26.

But Mourinho says Costa will be fit enough to face the final four games of the season, starting with the clash against Crystal Palace on May 3.

'Only Diego is injured, everybody else is fine and ready,' Mourinho said during the club's pre-match press conference on Friday. '[John Obi] Mikel is ready. [Cesc] Fabregas with a mask, but ready too. No problems.

'We have eight matches to play, if he [Costa] plays four it's normal,' Mourinho said.

'If he plays three it's a little bit below what I'm expecting. If he plays five it's more than I'm expecting.' 

Costa has a history of hamstring problems but Mourinho is refusing to let his focus shift from Sunday's game at Loftus Road.

Asked whether he was concerned about the former Atletico Madrid forward's latest injury, the Chelsea boss said: 'Not concerned. I'm concerned about the match on Sunday.

'At this moment I don't want to think of him (Costa) for two, three weeks.'

-----------------------------------------------
This is the dramatic moment two Typhoons came into land above an astonished father and son.

The video captured by William Bird while out with his seven-year-old stepson Alex shows the £126million jets approaching RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland.

The first of the aircraft - which can reach 1,370mph - blasted them with the thrust from its engines, while as the second jet disappeared from view the video camera was knocked sideways.

Scroll down for video 

Incoming: The video shows two of the £126million jets approaching RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland

Overhead: As the second jet disappeared from view in the clip, the video camera was knocked sideways

The video was taken on the same day that Typhoons were deployed by the Royal Air Force as two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace.

Mr Bird, who runs an aerial photography business in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, captured the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family.

The 41-year-old said that he was ‘as close to the action as you could get’, having gone to the area after hearing on the news that Nato exercises were taking place in the area.

He said: ‘I went to see what I could capture. I wasn't really sure what I would get but it was fantastic watching the video back.

‘They came in very low and were preparing to land, but they were still under quite a lot of throttle. To see that much thrust is quite astonishing. My stepson is still making jet noises.’

He added: ‘It's the first time I've seen a Typhoon in flight and the noise was just incredible. 

Caught on camera: Mr Bird took the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family

'You can hear it approach from far away, but when it's above you have to fight every instinct not to duck or put your hands over your ears.

‘Shortly after taking this video we were actually told we should probably move a bit away since the planes were coming in to land.’

As well as the bombers on Tuesday, a Russian warship strayed close to UK territory in another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences.

A destroyer with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels.

Just a few hours later the Bear bombers hugged UK airspace. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on the Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland.

Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled.

Iranians celebrate nuclear deal with U.S. , other world powers . Young people wave flags from sunroofs , blast music from stereos . The agreement was struck on the final day of Persian New Year festivities . Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif received a hero 's welcome .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)By the elation online and in the streets, you'd think Iran had just won the World Cup. But this is bigger.

Iranians erupted in celebration as young people waved flags from their sunroofs, blasted music from stereos and chatted online with the hashtag #IranTalks.

The excitement came after a breakthrough nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers that promises to end Iran's international isolation under years of crippling sanctions.

Just before midnight on Thursday, Vali Asr street, one of Tehran's main thoroughfares, turned into something like a block party.

Car horns blared. Men danced in the middle of traffic. Some people flaunted U.S. dollar bills. It was a fitting double occasion: The agreement was struck on the final day of Persian New Year festivities, symbolizing a fresh start.

Milad, a 20-year-old university student among the crowds, told CNN he was happy about the accord but wary about his own future.

"I still believe I'll have a hard time finding a job that pays well, with or without this deal."

Another Tehran resident, Alireza, 37, said "Things can't get worse than they are so, I'm happy with this news."

"This is pretty historic and I pray that my children will be able to live in an Iran that can play nice with the international community."

At home that evening, families watched as Iranian state television broadcast U.S. President Barack Obama's speech live, which came for many as a surprise.

Some Iranians celebrated the moment by snapping selfies in front of the TV.

Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif — who led the Iranian negotiation team — received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning.

"Long live Zarif," crowds chanted as the vehicle rolled slowly down the packed street, carrying the man who struck the historic deal.

Other videos posted to social media showed Zarif mobbed by fans in Switzerland, who yelled "We love you, Zarif!"

She closely followed the reaction from Iranians around the world and told CNN she saw an "explosion" of joy when the deal was finally struck.

"I didn't expect so many people to follow it so closely, but from the result, I can tell everyone was following."

"After 35 years of animosity, U.S. and Iran diplomats shook hands and stood by each other in public... everything is just pushing this forward."

-----------------------------------------------
A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club.

The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs.

Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening £800m takeover in 2005.

Scroll down for video 

Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' 

Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005

The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004

In it, he claims:

• Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons

• The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea

• Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them

• The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors

• Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room

• The Glazers are 'not ogres'

Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010.

But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side.

Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons.

'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit.

But they were back to speak to staff the following day.

'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds.

Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room.

'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.'

Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres – on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family.

He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.'

In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time.

The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned.

'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors.

'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad.

'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over?

Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval

Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani

'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.'

Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college.

Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff.

Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic.

'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals.

Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel.

'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes.

'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.'

The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani

Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs.

'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.'

He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?'

Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season.

The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport.

'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes.

'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.'

Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal.

He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'.

Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results.

He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming.

Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'.

'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered.

Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

Everton's Steven Pienaar has admitted he considered retirement as frustration took its toll during his injury-ravaged season.

The influential 33-year-old midfielder Pienaar has been dogged by groin and knee injuries this season limiting him to just 11 appearances. 

He returned to action from his latest setback in the 1-1 draw with Swansea City earlier this month but muscle fatigue ruled him out of the win over Burnley last weekend.

Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar is held back by Swansea's Ki Sung-Yueng at the Liberty Stadium 

Pienaar said: 'At one stage, I thought I had better just hang my boots up and call it a day but on the other side I was just thinking that I enjoy going in and seeing the guys so I just had to stay strong and that kept me going.

'When you are at home not coming in for training you feel very down but as soon as I walk through the door, there’s always the camaraderie in the group, there is always fun.

'Even if you are injured, you can always laugh and it keeps you going. Just to be among the players, it’s kept me going.' 

Pienaar has made just 11 appearances for the Toffees this season due to groin and knee injuries

Kathryn Beale , 41 , prepares fresh placenta for new mothers . She whizzes it into smoothies or grinds it into pills for women . Mothers have reported powerful properting from eating their placentas . Swindon Council is taking her to court saying they want to stop her .
-----------------------------------------------
Healing: Mothers have reported powerful properting from eating their placenta. Pictured: a smoothie

There is a tall glass of something very red and rather alarming on the kitchen counter when I meet Kathryn Beale at her three-bedroom home in Swindon. More scary still, she appears to be drinking it.

Fortunately it soon becomes clear that my suspicions are unwarranted, as the substance in the tumbler is nothing more troubling than plain old fruit juice.

But I am here because Kathryn is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff, and one very disconcerting product in particular.

The 41-year-old mother-of-two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers. Along with some 60 other specialists in this country, she whizzes it into smoothies, or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits.

Mothers have reported powerful healing properties, saying that eating their own placenta (the blood-filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb) has helped to increase their milk supply, reduce post-natal bleeding, stabilise blood pressure, and, crucially, provide them with more energy to care for their babies.

Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Hollywood actresses January Jones and Alicia Silverstone and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton. 

Kathryn has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients. Nor, for that matter, has any other practitioner in the 70-strong Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network (IPEN), of which Kathryn is a member.

IPEN estimates that between 4,000 and 5,000 women have used the service since it started in 2010, the majority in Britain. Yet Kathryn is in despair, having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business, but help put an end to placenta-eating across the country.

Natural: Kathryn Beale whizzes plcenta into smoothies or into pills for women convinced of its health benefits

Swindon Council is claiming that her services pose a danger to the mothers she is trying to help, and are taking her to court saying they want to stop her from trading. They have already taken half her essential kit, including a grinder and a pill-maker, meaning she can no longer provide her service.

She said: ‘It does seem like a witch-hunt. Why should they be doing everything they can to stop me providing a service which I believe helps new mothers? Yes, some people might be squeamish about it, but that doesn’t give the council the right to just close me down.’

IPEN director Lynnea Shrief lost her court battle against Dacorum Council in Hertfordshire last year. She believes the legal action is part of a national move to shut down the industry. Three other IPEN businesses have also faced opposition from local authorities.

It was in March that the council took action against Kathryn. Health bosses claimed that dangerous microbes would multiply while the placenta was being processed in her kitchen – with the risk of poisoning the mother.

Last month, Swindon failed to convince a magistrate to grant a hygiene emergency prohibition order against Kathryn, who contested the order. Despite noting her various food-safety certificates, and failing to advise how she might satisfy their health risk concerns, the council is trying again and she will re-appear in court in May.

Kathryn says of the council’s inspection: ‘It was clear they didn’t know how a maternity ward works. They had the impression that placentas were just falling out of women all over the floor and being put into buckets with other placentas. It’s just not the case.’

Kathryn provides her clients – mostly well-educated, professional women – with a large zip-lock bag into which the placenta is placed. The bagged organ is then put into a large leak-proof plastic box, which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for Kathryn to collect.

Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Mad Men star January Jones (left) and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton (right)

If the mother has requested a £20 placenta smoothie at the birth, Kathryn blends some with fruit and apple juice using a hand-held blender. She takes the remainder home and either steams the organ with lemon, ginger and green chilli, or dries slices of placenta in a dehydrator before grinding the pieces into a powder which she makes into capsules. This service costs £150.

Kathryn, a former primary school teacher turned birth ‘doula’ – a non-medical supporter for expectant mothers – became interested in placenta consumption after watching chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall flambee one on TV.

She added placenta processing to her birth doula business in March 2013 after a day-long IPEN training course. She obtained certificates in food safety for manufacturing, infection control, and HACCP, a food safety management system.

A Swindon Council spokesman said: ‘Preparation of foodstuffs using human placenta in this way can present a number of potentially serious health risks to those who consume them. We are legally obliged to investigate and take whatever steps are necessary to protect consumers.’

A key genetic mutation could explain why some children who catch flu are left fighting for their lives in hospital – while others just need a day or two in bed.

Scientists discovered the mutation after studying a two-year-old French girl who nearly died from the flu. They found she was particularly vulnerable because she had inherited a rare double genetic mutation from both of her parents which meant she was unable to produce a protein called interferon.

Interferon, which is commercially available, helps the immune system attack flu and could now be used to save young victims.

Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova, from the Imagine Institute of Genetic Diseases in Paris, and the St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Disease at Rockefeller University in the US, said: ‘This finding suggests that one could treat severe childhood flu with interferon.’

The girl, who was critically ill with flu in 2011, has not had the virus since, after being vaccinated annually. The researchers’ findings have been published in the journal Science.

-----------------------------------------------
The Turin Shroud, one of Christianity's most celebrated and hotly-debated relics, went on display to the public on Sunday for the first time in five years.

More than one million people have already booked their slots to see the piece of linen that devotees believe to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ between now and June 24.

'Whether you believe or don't believe, there is no doubt it is something special,' said an Italian man who was among the first visitors following the opening mass in the Italian city of Turin.

Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia presents the Holy Shroud, which will be on public display until June 24, 2015

Pilgrims have already made reservations to see the cloth, believed to have been used to wrap Jesus' body

Imprinted with the image of a man who appears to have been crucified, the shroud has been dated to the end of the 13th century, lending support to those who say it is a medieval forgery.

But it has retained its mystical air for many thanks partly to the fact that researchers have been unable to establish exactly how the image was created.

The Church does not officially maintain that Christ's body was wrapped in the shroud or that any miracles were involved in the creation of the image now on display.

But it does value the relic's symbolic value as a powerful representation of Christ's suffering.

'It is not a profession of faith because it is not an object of faith, nor of devotion, but it can help faith,' Turin Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia said earlier this week.

Local authorities are counting on the exhibition of the shroud in the city's cathedral to give a significant boost to the local economy at a time of stagnation across Italy.

The 14 foot-long linen has the faded image of a boarded man and has been a source of wonder for centuries

When the shroud was last presented to the public, in 2010, more than two million people filed past it.

Pope Francis decreed the latest exhibition to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of St John Bosco, a 19th century monk who devoted his life to the education of poor children in newly-industrialised Turin. 

Francis, who has family roots in the region, is due to visit the city and the exhibition on June 20-21.

The shroud will be on display for 12 hours a day between 7.30am and 7.30pm with an entry free but requiring reservation via the website www.sindone.org or a special call centre.

Viewers will be afforded only a few minutes each in front of the original although they will be able to linger longer at a specially-made model and a related exhibition.

Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey against MCCU Oxford . Former England star Andrew Flintoff believes time is running out for Pietersen to resurrect his England career .

-----------------------------------------------
Andrew Flintoff fears Kevin Pietersen is 'running out of time' to resurrect his England career.

Flintoff, speaking at the England and Wales Cricket Board's NatWest T20 launch, sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for 'probably the premier tournament' in this country.

The dual Ashes-winning all-rounder is less convinced, however, about Pietersen's prospects of forcing his way back into Test contention.

Former England star Andrew Flintoff thiks time is running out for Pietersen to resurrect his England career

Pietersen already has three Ashes series wins on his CV but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins, and Flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side.

The controversial record-breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after Alastair Cook's team were whitewashed 5-0 in Australia, but has taken heart from incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves' hints that there may be a way back after all.

Pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the 'clean slate' being presented to him, and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against MCCU Oxford in his first red-ball innings for Surrey since June 2013.

Flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for Pietersen.

'He's a fantastic player, but nobody just walks into any team - especially the England team, 'I'm back, I'm here, I'm playing',' Flintoff told Press Association Sport.

England have won their last three Tests under Cook, pre-dating a miserable World Cup, and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the West Indies.

Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago

It is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside, on current form.

'Which of them do you say "you're not playing!" for Kevin to come in?' Flintoff said.

'I just think Kevin is running out of time a little bit.

'If he'd started the season last year with Surrey, and scored run after run and put himself in the position... whereas now I think he's looking at the Ashes and he's just running out of time.

'That's not to say he (definitely) won't feature, but I can't imagine it's going to be in the near future.'

Flintoff is optimistic about England's fortunes, despite their winter woes, with or without Pietersen.

'Alastair Cook is so important, and you get the sense everyone within the England set-up wants him as captain,' he said.

'He's a popular lad, and a great player.

'Peter Moores, there aren't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke.'

The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket 

England, Flintoff believes, just need a little more support.

'I think sometimes as a pundit, ex-player, you forget how difficult it can be,' he added.

'In Australia, you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants Australia to do well.

'With England, I've never had a sense of that.

'It's about time we started talking them up. I think it's time we started supporting the side, getting behind Cook, Moores, the players.

'It's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who hasn't moved his feet. (I think) maybe we should be a bit better than that, and start celebrating the lads a bit.'

He is enthusiastic too about this summer's T20 Blast, insisting it is no poor relation of the Indian Premier League - or the Big Bash, in which he played last winter for Brisbane Heat.

Flintoff says Alastair Cook is so important to England despite poor showing in the first Test against West indies

Flintoff said: 'The competition gets stronger. It's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now, with the crowds and excitement behind it.

'We're seeing that, with some of the players coming over - the world's best, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum, (Glenn) Maxwell, (Aaron) Finch.

'I played in the Big Bash, and the standard was high (but) this stands up as a competition.

'You turn up at Old Trafford for Lancashire-Yorkshire, and get 25,000 people, then to Chelmsford where they're playing in front of packed houses - so I don't subscribe to that.

'Anything in this country, we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there.

'We don't really focus on what we've got.

Flintoff shares a joke with players at the Natwest T20 Blast launch at Edgbaston on Thursday

'I didn't see anything within the Big Bash and thought 'this is far better than what we've got at home'.'

Whether at 37 he will be a part of the Blast again, after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping Lancashire to win the tournament last summer, is another matter.

'I'm not arrogant enough to think I can just walk into the Lancashire dressing-room and say 'I'm back, I'm playing',' he added.

'The one reason I wanted to play (last year) is because I love it and I never want to look back at my life, when I'm older, and think 'I wish I'd done that'.

'I don't see failing as a problem. But I see not having a go as a crime.

'So I thought "I'm going to have a go", and I certainly loved it.'

For the 0.01 per cent, booking holiday travel is a far different experience than it is for the rest of us.

Instead of scrolling through holiday deals on bargain-finding websites, these ultra-wealthy individuals prefer to take off on a moment's notice and sort out any over-the-top accommodations and activities upon arrival.

To get a glimpse inside this elite - and rarely planned - world, MailOnline Travel spoke to wedding and event planner Sarah Haywood, who has helped organise ceremonies and honeymoons for everyone from celebrities to Fortune 500 businessmen.

For the super-wealthy, money is of no concern when it comes to booking private jets and chartering yachts

'Most of our clients have a private travel consultant,' Haywood explains to MailOnline Travel. 'There are several really upmarket agents where you pay a fee annually to have them take care of all your travel.'

Haywood reveals that she often works with these agencies, where she estimates that membership fees for such a service start at about £50,000.

'These aren't companies you'll find online,' she adds. 'The people that they're working with don't plan and they expect things to be catered to their whims.'

Victoria Hoffman, founder and CEO of the Miami-based Concierge & Events by Victoria, tells MailOnline Travel that some of the most common last-minute request include special access to exclusive events, such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Academy Awards or tickets to the White House Correspondence Dinner. 

Victoria Hoffman, who owns her on US-based concierge service, reveals she's had clients request special access to exclusive events such as the Cannes Film Festival

Specialist Italian travel company, Bellini Travel, set up by Emily FitzRoy 15 years ago, is so exclusive that it only caters to a carefully selected list of 100 clients a year.

'As we look after a limited number of people each year, we can pull in huge favours,' Emily said.

'For example, we're just in the middle of negotiating to close the Uffizi for a client who only has 24 hours in Florence, but wants to see Botticelli's Birth of Venus on his own.

Brown and Hudson describe themselves as the antidote to everything that is packaged and unconsidered about today’s luxury travel business.

Their bespoke service, which charges a minimum of £1,000 simply to create an itinerary for potential clients, has an impressive portfolio of bespoke experiences they have orchestrated for guests.

Alexander Martin, director of luxury lifestyle website The Envy Group agrees that for the super-rich, it's not about what you give, so much as the amazing experience behind it.

'Our clients - or 'friends' as we call them - are very successful and generous people, and we help them create unique lifestyle experiences that goes far beyond booking a table at an amazing restaurant.

'We recently organised the world's only Tiffany-blue Bentley for one of our friends, and created a 20ft Tiffany-inspired remote-controlled hydraulic gift box complete to deliver it in.'

And if you're heading to the luxurious five-star properties hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the world's wealthiest individuals, don't bother.

Haywood tells us the the ultra-elite don't often check in to big hotels, much preferring somewhere private for their opulent getaways.

'This is above just a private island in the Maldives,' she tells us. 'People with this kind of money aren't looking at what's fashionable, they're looking for privacy and security. 

'The world's wealthiest like to stay low profile, so we'll be looking at places where they can do that.'

Hoffman agrees, explaining that more and more clients have been asking her recently to rent villas and help them to live like a local. 

Instead of splashing out on a luxurious suite, the ultra-rich prefer to rent their own private Maldivian island

Haywood cites Cote d'Azur and the Maldives as two locations favoured by her A-list clientele, while Hoffman notes that she has planned extravagant vacation experiences everywhere from Paris to Italy.

'We once provided access to Coco Chanel's apartment and private jewellery collection,' Hoffman tells MailOnline Travel.

'The entire experience was a day in the life of Coco in which the clients dined and had afternoon tea in many of the places in Paris she frequented.

'In other scenarios, we have given privileged access to the private estates of winemakers in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Piedmont.

'In one case, my client wanted to relive the 18th century, so we had period costumes and horse-drawn carriages for the day. In another, we created a progressive feast in which each course was served at a different historic home in Italy.'

Travel around the world by private jet

Hurlingham Travel - price on application

Visit every UNESCO World Heritage Site in one holiday

Hurlingham Travel - from £1million

If you've ever wondered how many UNESCO World Heritage sites there are, and how long it would take you to visit them all, the answer is 922 and roughly two years.

At the time of going to press, the companies are in negotiations with a Chinese PHD student who is hoping to be whisked off on this incredible adventure once he completes his studies.

Hoffman tells MailOnline Travel that exclusive access to private wine estates in France is a common request

One of Hoffman's most impressive travel experiences included creating a 'day in the life' of Coco Chanel for a client visiting Paris

Elite wedding and event planner, Sarah Haywood, explains that the ultra-wealthy prefer not to book in advance

Haywood has also had very last minute requests that she has had to sort only hours before - and from many miles away. 

'Once, somebody was on a post-wedding shoot and they wanted a white horse at sunset,' she remembers.

'Finding a white horse at sunset, it is possible and it did happen, but for a few hours it was quite touch and go.

'And it turns out that white horses are actually grey, not white.' 

Haywood reveals that one traveller once asked her to find a white horse at sunset for a post-wedding shoot - only hours before they needed it!

In future, these one-of-a-kind holiday experiences will only become more popular. 

'People want a customised vacation focused around an annual event or theme,' Hoffman says. 

But such an extravagantly-themed getaway will cost you - as much as $100,000 for a dinner, depending on who its with.

'Pricing structure varies,' Hoffman adds. 'A VIP experience to France or Italy in which two people explore special access historic UNESCO sites not generally open to the public could have a starting range of $7,000 (£4,540), whereas dinner with a celebrity or athlete could have a starting cost of $100,000 (about £65,000).'

Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates , 73 , `` inadvertently '' shot Eric Courtney Harris . Harris ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting . As deputies tried to handcuff Harris , Bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)The reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun, and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot, were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect, according to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, investigator.

Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, "inadvertently" shot Eric Courtney Harris after Harris -- a possibly PCP-addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting.

As deputies tried to handcuff Harris, Bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand. He warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a Taser on the suspect, but instead, he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized, Clark said, citing a recently released video.

Clark attributed Bates' actions to a phenomenon known as "slip and capture." An example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission. The driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly, even though there's no clutch pedal, he said.

Quoting Bill Lewinski, executive director of the Force Science Institute, Clark further explained: "These are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another, and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended. In effect, your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction."

Bates announced that he was going to deploy his Taser, and he pulled the trigger only once, as he was trained to do, Clark said. Police are trained to "double-tap" when firing their handguns, he said. The gun jumped out of Bates' hand because he wasn't expecting recoil, Clark said, and Bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot Harris.

Quoting Lewinski again, Clark said, "This is the slip and capture. Under time pressure to address a perceived threat, his intention to draw his Taser slipped off his agenda, so to speak, when it was captured and completed by a more well-rehearsed motor program. ... He was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired. In his urgency, his concentration was focused exclusively on Harris' back, where he intended to place the Taser darts. Because of what's called 'inattentional blindness,' meaning that he wasn't consciously paying attention to and registering it, he wouldn't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the Taser. And in this case the weight of the gun and Taser are nearly identical."

Clark was emphatic that Bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim.

"Reserve Deputy Bates did not commit a crime. Reserve Deputy Bates was a victim, a true victim of slip and capture," he said. "There's no other determination I could come to."

When they set up the undercover sting, police wanted evidence on camera. But when they recorded the operation targeting Harris earlier this month, cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran, and as he was fatally shot.

The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office released the video on Friday. The shooting was an apparent accident, it has said.

In the last minutes of the video, Harris lies on the pavement with police on top of him. An officer calls for a Taser, but in place of an electric clicking sound, a gunshot rings out.

A voice can be heard saying, "Oh! I shot him! I'm sorry!"  Another officer screams out, "He shot him! He shot him!"

Harris, who is bleeding, calls out, too. He's losing his breath, he says. An officer yells back at him.

"You f**king ran! Shut the f**k up!" he yells. "F**k your breath," he said.

Clark defended the officer's language, saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion, never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running. The language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified, Clark said.

"One deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site. It's very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone's life and this deputy, one of the involved deputies, was upset," he said. "Secondly, this is total stress. They are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed."

Clark added, "They did not know that he was shot at this time. They had audio exclusion. They was at a point where they couldn't hear. They didn't even hear the gunshot go off. The officers did not know that Mr. Harris had been shot."

An officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from Harris.

Shortly after the suspect is shot, the officers begin tugging Harris' hands behind his back as the video ends.

Harris later died at a local hospital. Police said at the time of the shooting that Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine, a street drug commonly known as PCP.

The video is edited to block out the officers' faces. Harris is clearly visible.

Minutes earlier, Harris had climbed into a truck cab, where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect.

"What's up?" they greet each other cordially. Without missing a beat, Harris rummages deep in a backpack and hastily hands over a semiautomatic pistol. Every few seconds, he looks around outside nervously.

"Sweet, that's a nice gun, man," the undercover officer says off camera. It's a "German Luger," Harris tells him.

He cranes his head around quickly and watches as a car pulls up next to the truck. Officers in uniform jump out, and Harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off.

"He's running; he's running, he's running!" the officer in the truck says.

As Harris fled, police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip, "consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun," Clark said, adding that no gun was found when Harris was searched after the chase.

Another video from an officer's body camera picks up the chase. The officer wearing it jumps out of a vehicle and pursues Harris on foot, catching up to him easily. He tackles the fleeing suspect.

The officer commands him, "I need you to roll on your stomach. Now!" Other officers appear. Someone calls, "Taser! Taser!"

The gun discharges.

Much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck, two men are conversing. "He thought it was his Taser," one of them says, as the other curses in frustration.

In the background, a woman is crying "No, no, no!" Harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion.

Police have said that Harris had reached for his waistband, and officers feared he might endanger them. When Harris was on the ground, he "refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband," they said after the shooting.

The officer's body camera video did not reveal that area of Harris' body.

Bates, a former Tulsa police officer, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, the sheriff's office has said.

Asked whether Bates' age may have been a factor in the shooting, Clark said, "It's happened to 21-year-old law enforcement officers. It's happened to 30-year-old law enforcement officers. Age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events.

Despite the details released over the weekend, Harris' brother says he still want answers.

"I want to know if he was shot in the back accidentally or on purpose. These are all the things that not only I want, but the public wants," Andre Harris told CNN affiliate KTUL.

Bates' attorney, Scott Wood, told CNN on Friday he would contact the network later. He had not issued a statement or called back as of Sunday.

CNN's Jason Morris, Carma Hassan and Andreas Preuss contributed to this report.

Candice-Marie Fox was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011 . She underwent surgery and radiation treatment to ` mop up ' the cancer . Ms Fox rejected conventional treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online . Her diet program involved her drinking ` morning juice ' , dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins .
-----------------------------------------------
A Perth woman who claimed she cured her cancer using a dietary program where she ate vast amounts of pineapple has pledged to release her medical records after critics questioned claims about her 'magic diet'.

In the wake of recent controversy surrounding 'wellness warriors' such as Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson and the death of Gerson Therapy advocate Jessica Ainscough, bloggers have demanded 'irrefutable proof' that modelling agent Candice-Marie Fox cured her cancer 'with juice'.

Ms Fox said she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011. She initially had surgery to remove tumours from her neck that September and she then underwent a course of radiation treatment to 'mop up' the cancer in December.

But when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body, Ms Fox rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online.

Juice in hand: Candice-Marie Fox (pictured) claims to have cured her cancer with a nutritional program involving the heavy consumption of pineapples 

Ms Fox underwent surgery and radiation treatment. She is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details

'I was feeling a bit lost, just winging it on the internet myself,' she said, until she discovered a U.S. organisation called the Nutritional Oncology Research Institute.

She would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International. 

Her diet program involved her drinking 'morning juice', dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins. 

Ms Fox said when she returned to the doctors months after embracing her new lifestyle, medical staff found her cancer had been radically reduced in size and is now gone. 

'I have got rid of it all (the cancer) 100 per cent myself through just hardcore nutrition, loving myself and meditating, adopting all stuff I thought never would have worked,' she said. 

Bloggers have questioned that assertion, demanding medical evidence for her claims and questioning her understanding of her radiation treatment. 

'I am merely requesting that you are transparent about something as serious as being able to cure cancer using nutritional means,' one wrote.

'The truth is not negative or mean or bullying in any way whatsoever.' 

In response, Ms Fox said she was applying to obtain all her relevant medical records, which will take 45 to 60 days to obtain. She is planning release them in a PDF file, without personal details such as her Medicare number and contact details.

Ms Fox also said she is seeking a trusted independent investigator to examine her claims and insisted she is not promoting her cause for fame or money.

'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.'

Ms Fox (pictured) has been questioned by bloggers over claims she cured her cancer through a diet as well as meditation 

As part of the modelling world, Ms Fox is friends with The Bachelor Blake Garvey

'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.'

'All I know is, she's not me, I'm not her. 

'My story is so far removed from anybody else's story because it's mine. 

'It's unique, and it's exactly how it happened. 'So why am I not allowed to share that? 

'Why am I not allowed to help people heal? I'm not making money out of this, I'm not trying to hurt anyone.'

'I'm not a fraud and I'm not a fake'. 

Ms Fox said she 'totally understood' that people were sceptical and that people were concerned her message could discourage people from seeking conventional treatments - but that wasn't her agenda. 

'It just seems they've got this massive agenda to break down my story. 

'I know I can sleep at night and in my heart I am doing what I know to be right.'

'I haven't changed anything, I haven't deleted anything. 

'It really did change the way I f***ing lived'.

Cancer Council nutritionist Kathy Chapman said maintaining a healthy diet is 'one of the things you can do to support your treatment', but dismissed 'magic diets' as unproven.  

'I think it's really important for anybody who is facing cancer that they put their faith in medical doctors who are going to be backed up by sound research,' Ms Chapman said. 

'A lot of the people claiming these cures with special magic diets you need to ask - where's the scientific studies there to back them up, and they are missing in this case.'

Oncologist Dr Ian Olver, the director of the Samsom Institute, said there was evidence a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables with less red meat could prevent cancer. 

But Dr Olver, from the University of South Australia, said there was little evidence to suggest food could cure cancer and that he was concerned about the popularity of so-called 'wellness warriors'. 

'People may be lured into abandoning or not taking up potentially curative treatments because something's become popular for which there is no evidence. 

'Even if someone claimed they were cured by a certain diet, you'd like to know if that happened one in two (cases) or one in 20000 - but these anecdotes get blown up into suggestions for lifestyle.'  

Candice (pictured left) would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International.

Libyan army head Gen . Khalifa Haftar says Libyan authorities had not been consulted . `` Military action against Libyan territory is an unwise decision , '' he says . EU leaders are considering a plan that would involve military action against people smugglers .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)The head of the Libyan Army has rejected the possibility of cooperating with any EU military intervention in his country intended to stem the flow of undocumented migrants trying to reach Europe.

In an exclusive interview Friday with CNN's Becky Anderson, Libyan army head Gen. Khalifa Haftar said Libyan authorities had not been consulted and, in any event, military action would not solve the problem.

"We will certainly not cooperate, because we were not involved in resolving this issue," Haftar said. "The decision was taken without consulting the legitimate Libyan side."

The European Union is struggling to cope with an increasing number of people crowding into unseaworthy boats and trying to reach European shores. Many of the travelers are fleeing violence and poverty in Libya and elsewhere in the region.

The capsizing of one vessel last weekend left an estimated 900 people dead.

EU leaders are considering a plan that would involve military action against people smugglers at the source -- before they load their boats with human cargo. Of necessity, such an operation would involve operations within the territory of North African countries.

But Haftar expressed dismay at the prospect in his interview with CNN.

"Military action against Libyan territory is an unwise decision," he said. "You need to deal with the Libyan crisis as a whole. We are a sovereign country that needs to be respected despite what we are going through right now."

Haftar did not respond directly when he was asked whether Libyan authorities would confront any European forces within its territory.

"The European Union needs to stand with the Libyan people to solve the crisis instead of taking such decisions," the general said. "The migrant crisis affects them. But why don't they see that our problems are also very important? It's important for them to support us either on the humanitarian front or on the security front."

Pressed on the point, Haftar replied, "We do what's in the interest of the Libyan people. The European Union is looking after its own interests so we will also look after ours."

But he said Libya is open to other kinds of cooperation on the issue of migration.

"If they take the right approach, we will certainly cooperate," he said, referring to EU authorities. "The appropriate approach will benefit Libya and its fight against terrorism. And I repeat, that means lifting sanctions against Libya -- specifically those against the army."

Southampton supporters are planning on turning St Mary’s orange when they face Tottenham on Saturday to shun former manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Fans are campaigning to show support for their Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, his brother and assistant head coach Erwin Koeman and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg.

They are encouraging match-goers to wear orange instead of the usual red and white club colours to display their discontent at Pochettino leaving last year.

The Argentine is returning to St Mary’s for the first time since he signed a five-year deal at Spurs last May.

After he left, a swathe of key players followed and the place was shrouded in uncertainty about the season ahead. But Koeman made some shrewd signings to replace those departed and has guided the team to challenge for a place in Europe.

The outcome of the meeting with Pochettino could prove crucial in both clubs' pursuit of European football.

That is why fans are preparing the 'Ronald Koeman Day' to place extra pressure on Pochettino and his team.

The idea is thought to have come from the owner of clothing range Raw Spirit, Liam Edgar, who has designed orange t-shirts with Koeman’s quote ‘the key is to believe in ourselves’ emblazoned on the front. Local pubs, bars and restaurants have got behind the campaign.

Study by Socialist MP Guillaume Garot urges eateries to embrace ` le doggy bag ' Throwing still-edible food away costs the average French household $ 400 -LRB- # 285 -RRB- . UN report found 1.3 billion tons of food was wasted globally each year .
-----------------------------------------------
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, as French restaurateurs have discovered.

A report to the French government is urging eateries and customers to embrace 'le doggy bag' in a bid to reduce the staggering amount of food thrown away each year.

Socialist MP Guillaume Garot, the author of the study, said while the popular US practice was previously 'unthinkable' for snooty diners and chefs, a change in attitudes could save France up to €20 billion (£14 billion) a year.

French diners have previously seen doggy bags - popular in America and the UK - as 'embarrassing', but one MP has said increasing their use would stop the country wasting huge amounts of food

Chefs in France have treated takeaway bags with contempt, seeing them as 'degrading' towards their dishes

The MP has put forward 36 proposals including promoting 'doggy bags', which allow customers to bring their leftover meal home with them, as a way of stopping the rampant food waste in France, a report in The Daily Telegraph says. 

Throwing still-edible food away, the study continues, costs the average French  household €400 (£285) a year.

Mr Garot accepts that there is a cultural obstacle stopping diners asking for takeaway bags, with proud chefs seeing it as 'degrading' towards their carefully-crafted dishes.

But the scale of the food wastage problem in France means something must be done to stop the 'almost automatic' habit of waiters and cooks throwing away leftover food, he adds.

Throwing away still-edible food is costing the country up to €20 billion each year, the MP's study has found

A UN report found 1.3 billion tons of food was wasted globally each year, the equivalent of a third of food produced. 

Cash-strapped France is attempting to save money after its position in the Eurozone worsened considerably in 2014, a year that saw higher unemployment, an increase in the public deficit and a decrease in investment. 

French start-up company TakeAway told the newspaper introduced the 'doggy bags' - or 'le gourmet bag', as one union boss has suggested calling them - is considered 'a bit embarrassing'.

But a recent poll revealed that 75 per cent of French diners would consider making the most of the bags to enjoy the rest of their dinner later on.

Millionaire owner Gary Lowndes who purchased the property, advertised online as Pharaoh's Palace, in 2013 for $2 million has put it back on the market after being found in violation of country zoning codes over noisey parties

Owner Lownds, right has decided to sell the property he had once envisioned playing host to a reality show for strippers after complaints about noise from neighbors such as Ronald Nagy, left

Websites indicate there was property has also been home to Pharaoh's Daughters, a school for strippers, but Lowndes has repeatedly fallen foul of complaints about noisey private functions held on the grounds.

On Friday the county code enforcement board found that Lownds had violated their rules by holding events without the right permit and running a business in a residential neighborhood.

His company, Pink Tati LLC, was given seven days to prove the property is in compliance and he was warned he will be fined $1,000 a day if further commercial functions takes place.

'Basically it's the noise that got our attention,' neighbor Ronald Nagy told Bay News. He lives in the nearby Cheval West community. 

'I've never been involved in running a stripper school,' said Lowndes, who made millions selling mattresses and hearing aids. 

'There's never been any porn parties. There's never been anything illegal other than the noise complaint.'

Lowndes said he disagrees with the board's decision, but has decided that it is best if he sells up. He has put the property back on the market for $2.3 million.

'With all this violation stuff, I said, "fine, that's it, I'm out of here.'" he said.

An August 2014 adult-themed party dubbed Midsummer Night Wet Dream got the mansion its first noise complaint.

Neighbor Nagy had seen ads for the party and filed a complaint with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and Code Enforcement.

'This to me seems like there was an undercurrent of very sexually-related activities,' he told the Tampa Tribune. 'They're gaming the system.'

After months of complaints both Lownds and Sean Grey, the mansion's manager, got hit with code violations.

On its website, Pharaoh's Palace was advertised as the 'perfect' place for entertaining.

Other ads on the internet said it was available for rent to producers for music videos, television and film, as well as event planners and professional photographers.

But the mansion also became where Grey and Nicholas Worlds, a former adult-themed business investor, ran a modeling agency dubbed Pharaoh's Daughters.

'Turn your stripper job into a career in exotic dancing and achieve the elite lifestyle you deserve,' the website promises.

There is also a 'harem room' that includes a fully equipped wet bar and poker table, as well as a dance/fitness studio with two stripper poles and a parking garage that fits up to 40 cars.

Lownds said he and some of his partners had planned to film a reality show at the mansion about the day-to-day lives of strippers.

But he has since shut down the modeling school and stopped all commercial activity at the mansion, he told the Tampa Tribune.

'We are aware of what we are allowed to do and not to do,' Lownds said. 'We are conforming with all the zoning requirements.'

The mansion was hit with five citations from Code Enforcement, including for holding special events in a residential zone and for operating special events without approval.

But according to deputy Phil Acaba, who investigated the events, it was the parties that ended up shutting the mansion down.

'If they had flown under the radar, they'd still be in business,' he said. 'The noise was the issue that brought their downfall.'

She shot to fame as the pretty blonde on Prince Harry's arm, but Cressida Bonas is keen to make a name for herself away from the royal limelight.

The fledgling actress and dancer has been unveiled as Mulberry's new ambassador - and shows off her modelling skills in new imagery released by the British fashion giant.

The 26-year-old poses in an old courthouse in Clerkenwell,  London, wearing pieces from the Somerset-based brand's spring/summer 2015 collection.

Cressida Bonas, who found fame as Prince Harry's girlfriend, has been unveiled as Mulberry's new ambassador and showcases the luxury fashion house's designs and accessories in a new shoot

Shot by Robert Fairer, Cressida, an accomplished dancer, shows off her moves as she pulls some poses whilst modelling the new range.

The shoot follows the release of a short film last month for the fashion house. It features Miss Bonas, the youngest daughter of aristocrat Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon and entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas, dancing round an old court house and English country garden in a £1,800 dress.

Asked in the video if it was ‘nice’ being single, she replied: ‘It is actually, it is, it is’

The Sloaney blonde dated Prince Harry for two years until last April when they broke up. Since then, the budding star has been focussing on her acting and modelling career.

Cressida Bonas really is one of those lithe elegant dancer types we want to hate for being so damn beautiful but we just can't!

Once known for being Prince Harry's better half, the blonde beauty has now made a name for herself as a dancer and model, so it's no wonder she's bee snapped up by quintessentially British fashion house, Mulberry.

We love this sprightly spring-ready shoot for their SS15 collection, which is brimming with flirty frocks in pastel hues, but our fave has got to be this blushing pink dress here.

Check out that luxurious suede feel, laser-cut detail and flattering fit and flare cut. Even if it wasn't for all that exquisite detail, it's been donned by Cressida, so we predict it'll be flying off the shelves! So why not invest in a slice of timeless British style and snap up this frock now (right)?

Or take a peek at our fave picks from the high street below. This Missguided dress is so Cressida right now, we almost want to start pirouetting and skipping in an abandoned house too. Almost.

She has just finished playing Cecily in The Importance of Being Ernest at the London Oratory, the Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg’s son as a pupil. 

Prince Harry even attended the opening night of his former girlfriend’s play, and was heard laughing loudly throughout.

Last month, well-connected Cressida also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine, and later this year will make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring her good friend, Cara Delevingne, as well as Dame Judi Dench.

Cressida recently played Cecily in The Importance of Being Ernest at the London Oratory, where she was watched by ex-boyfriend, Prince Harry

As well as starring on the cover of Miss Vogue, Cressida has attended Mulberry's glamorous parties and events over the last few months 

‘I hope the focus is becoming more about skills that I have,’ she said in the interview with the Sunday Time’s Style magazine.

‘It’s really important to me not just to be known as…’ she added, drifting off without finishing the sentence, presumably referring to being known as Prince Harry’s ex.

She refused to discuss her relationship with the prince, only to comment on the media attention their romance prompted.

‘All that stuff is not real,’ she says. ‘It’s really important to remember that all it is is noise, noise that can be very loud at times.’ 

Miss Bonas dated Prince Harry for two years until last April when they broke up (pictured together when they were dating in March 2014 at the Six Nations)

Hillary Clinton claimed on Wednesday that all of her grandparents ` came over ' from other countries , but only one was born outside the US .
-----------------------------------------------
Hillary Clinton has told a series of whoppers about her family history in order to appear more sympathetic to immigrants'-rights activists, according to documents that surfaced online Wednesday.

Buzzfeed found U.S. Census records and Selective Service documents – draft cards – that establish that three of the former secretary of state's grandparents were born in America.

That clashes with what Clinton herself has claimed publicly, including Wednesday afternoon in Norwalk, Iowa.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Clinton claimed on Wednesday that all of her grandparents 'came over' from other countries, but in fact only one was born outside the US

Hillary was participating in a staged 'roundtable' discussion about small business issues in Norwalk, Iowa

'All my grandparents, you know, came over here,' she said during a small business roundtable event, 'and you know my grandfather went to work in lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and worked there until he retired at 65. He started there when he was a teenager and just kept going.'

Clinton made the statment to underscore her support for changing the status of milions of illegal immigrants.

'We are turning down people who really want to work,' she said. 'I mean, they are here to work. And a lot of them now have children who are American citizens, and they are doing the best they can to try to make a good life for themselves and their families.'

The underpinnings of her personal story, however, seem false. 

STAGING: Most reporters were kept out of the Capital City Fruit company 'for space reasons' although the warehouse had plenty of room to go around

Both of Clinton’s maternal grandparents, named Della Howell and Edwin Howell, were born in Illinois, according to Buzzfeed's records research.

And while her paternal grandfather, Hugh Rodham Sr., immigrated to the U.S, his wife Hanna Jones Rodham was born in Pennsylvania.

In a speech last year in Kentucky, Clinton claimed Hanna 'immigrated with her family as a young girl to Scranton [Pennnsylvania] and went to work, very young, in a silk mill.'

'She traced her Methodism back to the Wesley brothers themselves,' Clinton said, 'who converted her great grandparents in the small coal mining villages of Southern Wales.'

The Clinton camp quickly acknowledged the accurate Rodham family history.

'As has been correctly pointed out,' a campaign spokesperson told Buzzfeed, 'while her grandfather was an immigrant, it appears that Hillary’s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the U.S. in the early 1880s.' 

But the insider insisted that Mrs. Clinton had simply believed what her family members had told her.

Chelsea beat Arsenal 1-0 in their Premier League clash at the Emirates . Jose Mourinho started without a striker for the first time this season . Eden Hazard , Willian and Oscar have an element of fantasy about their play . But Mourinho wants function and the master simply wants results .
-----------------------------------------------
On paper Chelsea’s team sheet looked like an insult, one for the anti-football brigade to get their beaks into after Jose Mourinho went without an orthodox striker.

When reality bites, even his biggest detractors must concede that Mourinho’s decision to leave Didier Drogba on the bench until the start of the second half was another tactical masterclass.

Chelsea’s manager is staying true to the game — his game — because the end result will be a fourth Barclays Premier League title for this football club.

Oscar was part of a front three who interchanged roles during the first half to great effect for their boss

At times you are left wondering what Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar make of it all when Mourinho starts working on team shape six days before a clash with Arsenal.

This trio have an element of fantasy about their game, with those delightful touches around the corner and the clever wall passes that they can play at will. The master simply wants results.

To start without a striker, to ignore the collective groans around the country by starting Willian in a deeply withdrawn role behind Hazard and Oscar, was a statement of intent. 

Mourinho was forced into it, of sorts, because he has been deprived of Diego Costa and Loic Remy in recent weeks, and his warrior Drogba could not train all week.

Even so, you would not put it past Mourinho — who pulled a similar stunt by playing Andre Schurrle as a false nine at Manchester United last season — to have done it anyway.

When it comes to work-rate, discipline and desire, no-one can accuse these players of cheating. Everyone has a job to do in this team.

To watch Hazard, the PFA player of the year, Oscar and Willian sacrifice their A-game for the greater good of the team demonstrates a unique commitment to Mourinho’s methods. They have bought in.

What happened to the style, the swagger and the pomp about the team who won so handsomely at Swansea, putting five past Garry Monk’s side without reply at the Liberty Stadium on January 17?

They traded it for Mourinho’s tactics, using the extra time during the week following their Champions League elimination against Paris Saint-Germain for match-specific preparation.

With only one game a week since Chelsea went out on away goals on March 11, Mourinho has used the time on the training field to prepare for Premier League matches as a one-off. 

But Didier Drogba was available to Mourinho and he only used the Ivorian when Oscar went off injured

There is no question who had the upper hand in the managerial tactical battle, and it wasn't Wenger 

Willian was exceptional for his manager, pestering the Arsenal midfield when the Blues were without the ball

Ramires comes close after a ball into the box from Willian but is thwarted by Arsenal keeper David Ospina

Against Manchester United he deliberately conceded possession, suffocating Marouane Fellaini and waited to hit Louis van Gaal’s team on the break. They won 1-0, even if it was far from pretty.

Here at the Emirates, against a team with eight successive wins in the Premier League, he bewildered their defence by allowing his front three to rotate.

Willian was exceptional as he flitted across Arsenal’s back line and pestered Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin when he wanted to win back the ball.

The Brazilian forward engineered Chelsea’s best chance, a clever angled ball in the first half that found the feet of Ramires running into the box. Arsenal keeper David Ospina saved well. 

This was perfectly disciplined, if uncomfortable to watch at times as Mourinho looked on approvingly from the sidelines.

When he was forced into a change at the break because Oscar had been ferried to hospital with suspected concussion following his collision with Ospina, he turned to the experience of Drogba.

Oscar was substituted at half-time having not recovered from the blow with Ospina

At the age of 37 he served his team-mates well in the second half, chasing 60 yards towards his own goal at one point to stop the forward run of Nacho Monreal down the left.

Towards the end of the second half, as this game gravitated towards its inevitable conclusion, Chelsea relied on their captain John Terry’s leadership skills to see it home.

A year ago this team was experimental, with various formations on trial as Mourinho assembled his next title-winning team.

Here at the Emirates, it has finally taken shape.

272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome hospitalised in England . But actual number affected by their mother 's drinking could be far greater . World Health Organisation suggests one in 100 babies could suffer learning and behavioural problems .
-----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of children were admitted to hospital last year after being born brain damaged following exposure to alcohol in the womb, alarming new figures have revealed. 

In total, 272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome were hospitalised in England over the past 12 months, according to data from the official Health and Social Care Information Centre.

But the actual number affected by their mother' s drinking could be far greater, experts have warned.

Warning: New figures show that 272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome were hospitalised in England over the past 12 months, according to the official Health and Social Care Information Centre

Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer learning, behavioural and physical problems such as deformed limbs because of exposure to alcohol, according to the Sunday People.

That equates to about 7,500 every year.

Elizabeth Mitchell, of the National Organisation for Foetal Alchol Syndrome, told reporter Nicola Fifield: 'Children born with the syndrome don't get better. They are brain damaged.

'It is an enormous problem and one that is terribly sad and vastly under-diagnosed.'

TIp of the iceberg: Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer learning and behavioural problems because of exposure to alcohol in the womb

One teenager who was born with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is 15-year-old Niamh Brown.

She needs help getting dressed, has no sense of danger and will never be able to live independently.

Niamh was three when her adoptive parents Julia and Simon first noticed something was wrong.

She stuggled at playschool, having difficulty holding a pencil and paying attention.

Two years later, at the age of five, Niamh was diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome from her birth mother's drinking.

In 2007, Julia and Simon set up the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust to help others. Visit www.fasdtrust.co.uk 

Other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy include problems with the liver, kidneys and heart, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy.

Pregnant women are advised by the Government not to drink alcohol. If they do, the maximum consumption recommended is up to two units no more than twice a week.

But Ms Mitchell believes the guidance should be changed so that women are advised not to drink at all during pregnancy.

Liverpool face a major rebuilding job this summer following a mass exit from Anfield.

Manager Brendan Rodgers, who has suffered another trophyless season after the shock FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa, could see up to 10 of his stars leave.

Captain Steven Gerrard has already agreed to join MLS side LA Galaxy, while defender Glen Johnson is out of contract and set to go on a free transfer. Kolo Toure is also out of contract and considering whether to accept the offer of a new deal.

Raheem Sterling is embroiled in a contract stand-off with Manchester City certain to make an offer and Juventus the latest big European club linked with him.

Defender Martin Skrtel’s future is also unclear as he is yet to agree a new contract with Wolfsburg planning a move for him.

Right-back Javi Manquillo is set to return to Spain after failing to make an impact while Mario Balotelli’s £16million switch from AC Milan has been a disaster. Liverpool will listen to offers for him, although getting rid of a man on £90,000 per week will be easier said than done.

Balotelli’s fellow strikers Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert could also depart.

Finally, Liverpool are looking for a goalkeeper to replace or put pressure on Simon Mignolet, meaning Brad Jones is the tenth name who would be surplus to requirements.

There was one good piece of news for Liverpool fans on Monday night when Jordan Henderson agreed a new £100,000-a-week deal until 2020.

Henderson, 24, is the third player in the squad to agree a contract extension, following Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho.

Detective Constable Ciara Campbell accused of spying on ex-partner . Court heard she also spied on PC Stuart Swarbrick 's new girlfriend . A ` large number ' of photographs of his new partner were found on her iPad . The 43-year-old denies three counts of unlawfully obtaining personal data and eight offences of unauthorised access to computer material .
-----------------------------------------------
DC Ciara Campbell (pictured) was an officer at Lancaster CID. She is accused of prying on former partner PC Stuart Swarbrick 200 times over a year

An ‘obsessed’ woman detective used confidential police computer systems to spy on her firearms officer ex-lover and his new partner, a court was told.

After Detective Constable Ciara Campbell broke up with police marksman Stuart Swarbrick, a ‘large number’ of photographs of his new partner, a civilian police worker, were found on her iPad, a jury was told. 

The 43-year-old, formerly of Lancaster CID in Lancashire, is accused of spying on her ex-partner PC Stuart Swarbrick 200 times between January 2013 and January 2014.

A court heard Campbell also spied on PC Swarbrick's new girlfriend, Alice Coxhead, a civilian police support worker, 50 times using the system.

However, the court was told that Campbell maintains she was simply trying to ensure she did not bump into or confront her ex or his new partner at work and wanted to ‘just get on with her job’. 

The DC denies three counts of unlawfully obtaining personal data and eight offences of unauthorised access to computer material under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

The first two charges relate to her accessing information on Lancashire police systems between 2010 and 2012 about a harassment dispute involving her friend Amanda Holman, 54, and a woman named Rachel Lyne.

The third charge against Campbell relates to her checking on a defendant – Dean Harrison – who was accused of assaulting Ms Lyne.

The court heard Harrison had approached Holman to ask her to be a witness.

The other charges relate to Campbell accessing information through incident and human resourcing databases about her ex-partner, who is a Preston-based firearms officer, and his new partner, who is based at Hutton police HQ.

Geoffrey Lowe, prosecuting, said Campbell’s relationship with PC Swarbrick ended in 2013 after which he started seeing Miss Coxhead. 

All three served with Lancashire Police. 

‘The defendant makes it clear she found the break-up of that relationship very traumatic and what seems to have happened is as a result she has embarked on an obsessive and irrational course of conduct,’ he added.  

'It seems the relationship came to an end in 2013. Mr Swarbrick commenced a relationship with Miss Coxhead.

Campbell was arrested in March 2014 over the matters relating to Holman, but an examination of her personal iPad which was seized by officers revealed pictures of Ms Coxhead, leading to a further probe.

Campbell, her ex Stuart Swarbrick and his partner all worked for Lancashire Police (headquarters pictured)

Mr Lowe said: 'As a result of inquiries the defendant's phone and iPad were seized and what's particularly significant is there were a large number of photographs obtained of Alice Coxhead.

'There are deleted inquiries about her, relating to her daughter and her father' s funeral.

'All of this, the Crown says, is reflective of the obsessive, irrational behaviour which drove this defendant to abuse the systems held by Lancashire Constabulary.'

Mr Lowe told the court checks revealed she had initially accessed the information about friend Ms Holman following an harassment dispute involving Ms Lyne.

Mr Lowe said Campbell had twice accessed information on her friend but added she may have done so out of 'some sort of misguided loyalty' to Holman.

He added: 'The Crown's case is she had no business to do that.'

The jury heard Campbell also accessed the computer system in August 2012 in relation to an alleged assault on Ms Lyne by a man named Dean Harrison.

David Temkin, defending, said: 'She did what she did in the first counts for a police purpose - the provision of information she says had been provided to her by her friend Amanda Holman. 

'She wished to give details of her home address. She says she  had many reasons to form the view that what she was doing was perfectly acceptable.'

Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) heard Campbell denies three counts of unlawfully obtaining personal data and eight offences of unauthorised access to computer material under the Computer Misuse Act 1990

He added Campbell had not wanted to bump into or confront her ex or his new partner at work and wanted to 'just get on with her job'.

He said in the case of the third charge, the one in relation to the assault, she just wanted to check she would have no involvement in the assault case.

He added: 'The actions she took were rational and sensible.

'On the remaining counts it is said she knew she was not authorised to access that data. 

'She says she didn't know that at all, she had many reasons to form the view that what she was doing was perfectly acceptable.' 

Giving evidence, DC Les Clegg, of Lancashire police's anti-corruption team, said text messages between Holman and the defendant appeared to correspond to her accessing information about Dean Harrison.

In a later message, Holman had thanked her and indicated she would not be 'speaking to him' - said by the Crown to refer to Dean Harrison. 

The trial continues.

He was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move — before Dann got the ball (1) and for Murray’s finish (3). The speed of it, plus two players blocking his view, made it unbelievably hard for him to get all three right.

-----------------------------------------------
Forget football and females and other traditional pub banter - modern men are more likely to chat about their children over a pint with their friends.

Relationship issues and sexual problems are also high on the agenda for discussion down the boozer.

Those were the findings of more than 70 hours of footage from hidden cameras in one London pub. 

Session: Secret cameras at an east London boozer showed that men are more likely to discuss sexual problems and relationship issues than the weekend's football matches

They didn't pick up a single mention of football, while women were discussed only occasionally. 

One man in the Lord Nelson pub was heard telling his friends how he realised he was gay while dating a married woman.

Three middle-aged men talked openly about erectile dysfunction and another spoke about his fears about having a kidney transplant.

Another customer at the pub on the Isle of Dogs, which attracts drinkers from all walks of life, including professionals from nearby Canary Wharf, told his companions the lack of affection shown to him by his parents means he values their friendship all the more.

Landlady Kim Arrowsmith said: 'There are a lot of things today that women won't put up with. That's why the males know that now they have to be more sensible.'

She said that although people knew they were being filmed for Channel 4, they soon forgot the cameras were there. 

The Secret Life of the Pub will be shown on Thursday.

Three young people got out of their red ute to threaten another driver . One was armed with a dagger and stabbed the car 's bonnet . The driver has been suspended for 12 months from driving and hit with a $ 2000 fine .
-----------------------------------------------
Terrifying footage has emerged of young thugs who got out of their vehicle to threaten another driver while one was armed with a weapon at a set of traffic lights.

The dashboard camera has captured the unnamed driver travelling along a Melbourne road when a red ute with P-plates quickly cuts into the lane to turn right at an intersection.

Moments later, the red ute appears to look frustrated at the slow moving traffic as they attempt to overtake by carelessly swerving onto the wrong side of the road, A Current Affair reports.

As the driver in front passes through another intersection, the ute seemed to have slowed down until they dashed passed an amber light before ramming the innocent driver.

When the red ute pulled in front of the vehicle at a red light, three young people got out to confront the threatened driver.

The ute driver is seen wandering off the screen while a young woman, donning a black hooded jacket, pulls the middle finger at the driver as she walks closer to the vehicle.

Within seconds, she pulls a dagger out of her side and stabs the bonnet of the car before the three are seen walking back to their ute.

It started when the red ute driver appeared frustrated with the slow traffic before ramming into another car

It's not known as to what happened next after the video stopped or whether anything else had triggered the bizarre road rage incident where three angry people got out of the red ute.

But driving expert Ian Luff was disgusted with the behaviour after watching the disturbing footage.

'That's just completely crazy and I'd hate to be that driver,' he told A Current Affair.

'I'm absolutely appalled - what we saw is someone completely out of control.'

Lucy Southern worked behind the bar at Britannia Hotels in Leeds . Claims she was quizzed about her sex life and groped by Alex Nkoroi . She also claimed he stood behind her to ` grind ' up and down her back .
-----------------------------------------------
A waitress on a zero-hours contract who kept silent over her boss groping her because she feared her hours would be cut has won a £20,000 payout at an employment tribunal.

Lucy Southern, who worked behind the bar at the hotel owned by Britannia Hotels in Leeds, was quizzed about her sex life and asked whether she wore stockings in bed by her line manager Alex Nkoroi.

She complained in August 2013 but nothing was done and in October, Nkoroi began touching her, slapping her bottom and kissing her on the neck.

Lucy Southern worked for Britannia Hotels and claims she quizzed about her sex life and groped by her line manager Alex Nkoroi 

She also claimed he stood behind her to 'grind' up and down her back, simulating sex.

He later stroked her back and prodded her in a private area with a pen, the hearing was told.

At a meeting with the hotel manager, James Whittaker she told him: 'I didn't want to say anything in case he gave me less shifts.

'I feel like I have to get on with him so that I get my hours.'

Ms Southern, who was 22 at the time and no longer works at the hotel, added: 'If I take back what I said about Alex I can just get my hours back can't I?'

In the judgement of the panel, which found both Nkoroi and Brittania Hotels guilty of sex discrimination by way of harassment but cleared them of indirect sex discrimination, the tribunal stated: 'The claimant was a casual member of staff.

'She had a zero hours contract and it was certainly her belief whether right or wrong that the second respondent (Nkoroi) would be able to influence the number of hours that she would be given to work.

'When James Whittaker had every reason to believe that a manager had engaged in repeated sexualised behaviour in the workplace, during working hours, with a subordinate member of staff, he did not think that any form of disciplinary sanction was appropriate.'

After the tribunal application was lodged, the hotel reinvestigated but found only one count, the neck kissing to be proved and that Miss Southern had encouraged it.

Nkoroi was then required in September last year, to attend a bullying and harassment training course.

When Miss Southern appealed against the decision of the second investigation, a third investigation was undertaken, but they rejected the appeal.

Nkoroi had always denied all the allegations, but at the tribunal in Leeds, after saying he was a practising Christian and swearing on the bible, he refused to deny the accusations, though he said he had forgotten some and that some of the touching might have been accidental.

He added that he may have had a conversation with her about her sexual practises but that it would have been in the context of a discussion about his religious beliefs.

The panel added: 'We have no hesitation in concluding that the events complained of by Miss Southern occurred.'

An employment tribunal at the City Exchange in Leeds, pictured, ordered Britannia Hotels to pay Miss Southern £19,500 in compensation for injury to her feelings 

It emerged at the hearing that Miss Southern suffers long-term mental health problems, but had made her employer and Nkoroi aware of it.

The panel added: 'There can be no doubt that the claimant perceived such conduct to be humiliating, to have been degrading and to have violated her dignity.

'The other circumstances of the case of relevance are her age, her mental health history and the fragility that the illness was likely to cause and the fact that the perpetrator was a manager in a position, as she believed, to determine what work would be offered to her.

'She took great offence at being touched. She tells us it made her feel dirty and angry. She felt trapped. She felt that she did not know how to handle the situation.'

They added: 'We cannot identify what Mr Nkoroi's purpose was in behaving in that way and to be charitable towards him he may not have appreciated the extent of the upset that he was causing although, as a manager, if he had had any worthwhile equality training, it should have been self evident that what he was doing was simply wrong.'

The tribunal awarded her £19,500 compensation for injury to her feelings, explaining: 'Where persistent harassment over a period of eight months has occurred, substantial compensation is likely to be justified but where the employer then has the means of addressing the problem, but wholly fails to do so in relation to a process that takes another year to complete, the impact upon this claimiant was clearly likely to be magnified.

'It cannot be underestimated how the claimant must have felt when she was and indeed has continued to be persistently disbelieved.'

A 46-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison on Monday after shooting dead a father and son because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago.

Alfred Guy Vuozzo swore loudly as he was told he would not be eligible for parole for 35 years for murdering Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon, 39, on Prince Edward Island last August.

As he was escorted from the courtroom, he screamed: 'You've sentenced me to life and I sent them to death', while the judge called the brutal double-murder an act of 'hatred and misdirected vengeance'.

Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, later received a nine-month sentence for dangerous driving.

'Revenge': Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, has been sentenced to life in prison after shooting dead Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon (both pictured), 39, because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. The defendant was told that he will not be eligible for parole for 35 years

Crash: Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, received a nine-month sentence. Above, a newspaper photo of the crash

After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home on St Mary's Road, near the town of Montague, CTV News reported.

He shot them both in 'execution-style' killings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the crash that had claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago.

In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. At the time, he told the court that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'.

He added he had needed to do something for her. 'Call me a cold-blooded killer, but I'm not,' he said.

Before his sentencing on Monday, Vuozzo said Herbert's 'short' sentence 'has haunted me all my life', saying: 'That's all her life was worth. She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.'

Shooting: After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home near Montague, Prince Edward Island, and shot them. Above, police at the scene

Emergency vehicle: He killed both in 'execution-style' slayings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the car crash that claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago

However, Crown lawyer John Diamond told the provincial Supreme Court in Charlottetown that Vuozzo was a 'cold-hearted' murderer who had shot his victims with a handgun to get 'revenge'. 

'It was revenge. He was a cold-hearted and calculated individual,' he told the court, CBC reported. 

Mr Diamond also called the double-murder on August 20 'callous', 'pointless', and the worst crime in the Island's history, adding that it has caused life-long pain for surviving McGuigan family members.

In a victim impact statement, Brent's wife and Brendon's mother, Marie McGuigan, who was home at the time but was not targeted by a hell-bent Vuozzo, said 'a part of me died with them that night'.

Attack: In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. He said that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. Above, the scene of the killings

Meanwhile, Brent's only daughter, Donna, said she has been consumed by hatred. 'I feel so much anger and hatred that it scares me. I hate that they died this way and it haunts me,' she sobbed.  

At an earlier hearing, Gerald Quinn, prosecuting, explained how Cathy had been fatally thrown from a car being driven by her father when it was struck by Mr McGuigan, who was driving a truck, in 1970.

The youngster's father and two other children also received minor injuries in the crash, but Herbert was not injured, The Eastern Graphic reported. Cathy died on the scene near Commercial Road.

Mr McGuigan has since passed away. Referring to Brent and Brendon, Quinn said: 'These two men, by all accounts, were good hard-working men, had no involvement whatsoever in the motor vehicle accident years ago, at all.

He added: 'This gentlemen [Vuozzo] had no familiarity with them other than knowing who they were. He walked into the home and he shot them both multiple times and killed them.'

Thane MacEachern, defending, argued that the defendant had no previous criminal record and had suffered from depression and mental illness prior to the shootings, according to CBC.

Vuozzo, of Lower Montague, will be 81 by the time he is eligible for parole. The first 25 years' ineligibility are for his first-degree murder charge, while the other 10 years are for killing Brendon.

In 2011, federal legislation was passed allowing courts to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility in cases where defendants have been convicted of multiple murders.

Magic's fate has sparked fury in the equestrian community, and an appeal for his whereabouts has been shared 58,000 times on social media sites.

Jade Walters, 21, was shocked to discover the family she loaned her beloved pet horse Magic to had sold the animal (pictured right and left being ridden by Miss Walters) for £200

Selling a horse at auction is notoriously risky – bidders are not vetted and some horses are bought for slaughter.

Miss Walters said: 'We would never in a million years have considered sending Magic to auction – they're horrible places. The thought makes me cry.'

It was two months before she discovered the horse had been sold – making it all the more difficult to trace Magic, who could have been taken out of the country or sold to an abattoir.

Miss Walters, who had owned the 17-year-old chestnut pony for seven years, said: 'I consider him like a child, he thinks of me as his mum and he's been taken from me. My heart is broken.

'He could be anywhere by now, I don't know how to find him and even if we do, what state will he be in?'

The care assistant from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, advertised for a temporary owner last year after the cost of his upkeep went over £4,000 a year. A woman in the West Country responded and took Magic to help her daughter improve her riding.

Miss Walters said: 'He was getting very expensive. Loaning a horse is common for people who can't afford the expense of the purchase but can afford the upkeep. So while they don't have ownership, they have a duty of care.

'I was naive. The woman I loaned to seemed very respectable and said she wanted her 12-year-old daughter to get more experience riding.'

But after six months, Magic's temporary owner said keeping the pony was too expensive and he was proving too difficult for her daughter to ride.

They agreed that she would help Miss Walters look for an experienced rider to buy him for £500. But just 12 days later, on February 10, Magic was auctioned. However, Miss Walters did not find out until last week when she decided to bring Magic home.

'He has always been treated like a prince, so being fought over at an auction by a crowd looking for a quick deal makes me sick.'

Her mother Julia, 53, said the woman had no right to auction Magic, adding: 'The arrangement was that if she had any interested parties, she would pass them to me.

'In no way was Magic to be sold without our knowledge.'

Last night, the seller insisted there was 'another side to the story', but declined to comment further.

Peter Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor prison . He is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse . But families of his victims are furious at plans to move him to a low-security Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland .

Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed

The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit.

Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women.

But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland.

Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial.

A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead.

But families of his victims are furious about the move.

Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all.

'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.'

A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room.

Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail.

Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory

Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals

He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours.

It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions.

It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism.

In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported.  

A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard.

He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes.

Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed

The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland

While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park.

Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite.

A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit.

The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds.

Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering.

Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.'

The full list of facilities include: 

The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack.

The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately.

The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him.

‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’

Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree.

The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. 

He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left 

It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell.

Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected.

In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. 

The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.

Gerard Pique has heaped praise on Barcelona's attacking trio of Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar, claiming he has never seen a relationship like theirs.

The Spanish giants are in France ahead of their crucial Champions League quarter-final tie against Paris Saint-Germain, and Pique took some time out to wax lyrical about his team-mates.

Speaking to UEFA.com, the Spain centre back said: 'I've never before seen a relationship like the one between Luis [Suárez], Ney [Neymar] and Leo [Messi].

'We're talking about three of the best players in the world.'

Continuing, and perhaps in a sideways swipe at the relationship between Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo at La Liga rivals Real Madrid, Pique said: 

'Being a footballer always goes hand in hand with a certain amount of egotism, but those three really do have a special relationship. 

In Madrid, there has been much speculation over Cristiano Ronaldo's (left) frustration with Gareth Bale

Barcelona are preparing for their Champions League quarter-final match against Paris Saint-Germain

'They get on superbly. There's no hint of jealousy and that shows on the pitch.' 

Ronaldo's frustration with Bale has received much media attention over the last month, culminating in the Portugal star's non-celebration and apparent frustration at Bale taking the limelight to score a goal against Levante in March.

Over in Barcelona, the Nou Camp's front three have a combined 88 goals between them in all competitions this season, and could add to that when they take to the field at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night.

Rangers beat Hearts 2-1 at Ibrox on Sunday night . Kenny Miller and Haris Vuckic scored the goals in the first half . Genero Zeefuik pulled back a late consolation for Robbie Neilson 's men .
-----------------------------------------------
Stuart McCall on Sunday night admitted the finest performance of his short Ibrox reign left him with ‘goosebumps’ and a growing belief that he can steer revitalised Rangers up to the Premiership.

On a day which ended with Ibrox captain Lee McCulloch publicly apologising for a reckless red card, first-half goals from Kenny Miller and Haris Vuckic were enough to ensure the captain’s 44th-minute folly did not prevent Rangers securing an important three points against Championship title winners Hearts.

Genero Zeefuik pulled back a late consolation for Robbie Neilson’s men but Rangers closed out the game to make it three wins in a row as McCall’s improving side leapfrogged Hibs into second place with six games remaining.

And last night the delighted Ibrox caretaker boss admitted he is starting to trust that his players can take charge of their own destiny in the end-of-season play-offs.

‘I’m beginning to trust the players the more and more I work with them,’ said McCall. ‘I’m very proud of the team and the fans. Hearts had won nine on the bounce before today and they are champions for a reason. They’ve won 26 out of 30 games.

‘But we scored two terrific goals and the tempo and passing in the first half in particular was outstanding.

Haris Vuckic (centre) scored the decisive goal for Rangers in the 2-1 victory that moved them into second

‘The second half was about guts and desire and being a good team-mate. ‘It was a hard shift and there were a lot of tired boys at full-time — but it was a deserved win in the end.

‘I’ve got to say that was probably the first time for a long, long, long time — probably since I was playing — that I have been out there and got goosebumps. I thought the boys deserved their applause at the end.

‘Hibs have lost three on the bounce now and we’ve won three on the bounce, so that shows how things can change quickly in football.

Rangers were reduced to 10 men when captain Lee McCulloch was dismissed from the pitch

Staurt McCall says the Gers captain apologised to him as well as the players after the incident

‘We’ve got a tough game at Queen of the South on Thursday and all we want is to keep improving.

‘But we can take belief, confidence and momentum forward from this.’

After the match, McCulloch made a brief appearance on BT Sport to apologise for his red card for an elbow on Osman Sow.

He said: ‘I felt as though I was caught in no-man’s land, if he won the header there would have been a runner in.

Genero Zeefuik tapped in from close range as Hearts scored a consolation against Rangers

‘There was no intent whatsoever, I can say that honestly, but obviously I’m disappointed.

‘I’ve apologised to all the management, all my team-mates, I feel as if I’ve let myself down.’

McCulloch is out of contract at the end of this season and when asked if he would like to remain at Ibrox, he said: ‘Of course I want to stay here. I’ve got a part to play I feel for the run-in and get the club back to where we want to be.’

McCall plans to watch the incident again before deciding what action, if any, to take against his captain, who now misses Thursday night’s match at Queen of the South.

Victory for Rangers moves them into second and continues their resurgence under Stuart McCall

He said: ‘I missed the challenge but the referee said he’s caught the boy with an elbow.

‘Jig’s come in and apologised to me and the team afterwards, so it must have merited a red card.

‘Am I disappointed that such an experienced player would do that at such an important time of the season? That’s a good question but I’ve not had time to think about it. I’ll look at it then speak to him.’

McCulloch walks off the pitch after he was shown the red card on Easter Sunday

But McCall praised the attitude of the players who remained on the park and won three points.

‘Attitude and desire has got to be a gimme if you want to play here at Rangers,’ he added.

‘It’s easy to buckle and go into your shell when things aren’t going well but we saw today people puffed out their chests. 

‘They are enjoying themselves because of the way we are playing and results. But they know if they don’t perform like that every week they will be out of the team.’

Former Huddersfield centre Josh Griffin scored a try and kicked three goals as improving Salford secured back-to-back Super League wins with an 18-12 triumph at the John Smith's Stadium.

Griffin and Ben Jones-Bishop scored tries in the first half, although Jack Hughes gave the Giants hope.

Carl Forster's try and Griffin's penalty made the game safe, though, despite the prolific Aaron Murphy's try setting up a tense finish.

Salford Red Devils secured a second win in a row with a 18-12 victory at Huddersfield 

Salford made a fast start and Cory Paterson had a try ruled out on 18 minutes. A Rangi Chase kick-through was fumbled by a Giants player in the in-goal area and Paterson pounced but referee James Child had already ruled it a knock-on and given the Red Devils a drop out.

The game was twice delayed early on when Kevin Locke for Salford and Huddersfield's Brett Ferres were carried off injured.

Griffin opened the scoring on 21 minutes when he pounced on a mistake by Huddersfield's Jermaine McGillvary.

The winger seemed set to grab a grubber kick into the left corner by Jones-Bishop - but when he slipped in the in-goal area Griffin was there to score.

He failed to convert but was on target 10 minutes later after Jones-Bishop took advantage of more slack defending.

Rangi Chase kicked through straight from a scrum and Jones-Bishop got to the ball first despite several Giants players being better placed.

Lacklustre Huddersfield, seeking a fifth straight win, woke up after that and were back in the contest on 38 minutes.

On-loan Wigan forward Hughes went over from Jamie Ellis' pass after good work by Eorl Crabtree.

There was a flare-up on half-time when Crabtree and Weller Hauraki came to blows after the Kiwi made a heavy tackle on the England international.

Salford extended their 10-6 half-time lead on 55 minutes when Forster grabbed his first try of the season.

Griffin, the older brother of fellow former Huddersfield player Darrell, who was on the bench for this match, converted.

Hauraki was put on report on 62 minutes for a bad tackle which left Giants full-back Scott Grix needing treatment.

Murphy then went over in the right corner on 76 minutes for his fourth try in as many games. Brough added the extras to leave the home side a converted try away from a late victory.

But soon after they were punished for interfering with play and Griffin kicked the resulting penalty.

Solid defending, including forcing Huddersfield to play out a set of six around their own 10-metre line, helped Salford see the game out.

'When I was president, we often talked about Klopp and believe he would fit very well at Bayern.

'Klopp is definitely an option at Bayern. The question is, how long Guardiola will be in Munich. I hope for a long time, but Klopp would be considered.

'I can't imagine that Guardiola would leave in 2016. He likes Munich. He has had success with the team and he knows that he can succeed in the future. He has everything he wants.'

Guardiola's side were named Bundesliga champions on Sunday and the Spaniard will be hoping to continue the quest for silverware when he faces former club Barcelona in the Champions League.

He said: 'Messi is a divine player. The whole team stands and falls with Messi. If Bayern manage to take Messi out of the game then they have a chance.

'If you really want to have a chance against Barcelona, ​​then you need to have a complete team. You need Franck Ribery, David Alaba and Arjen Robben.'

The mother of a three-year-old boy who was killed when a runaway two-tonne trailer mounted the pavement and crushed him to death is being targeted by online trolls who blame her for the incident.

Donna Hussey, 32, has also been branded a 'bad mum' by trolls on Facebook over the death of her son Freddie - who was killed when a huge portable cabin came loose from a passing Land Rover.

Mrs Hussey, who had just dropped her eight-year-old son Archie to school, was helpless as the runaway trailer mounted the pavement and crushed young Freddie against a wall in Bedminster, Bristol.

A passing lorry driver tried to resuscitate Freddie and paramedics arrived within minutes, but he died shortly afterwards at Bristol Children's Hospital.

Police investigators found the trailer had not been correctly attached to the Land Rover but driver Tony Davies avoided prison after admitting causing death by careless driving.

His sentence infuriated Mrs Hussey and Freddie's father Scott, 37, who blasted his punishment of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service as a 'joke'.

Mrs Hussey said her torment has now been worsened further by hateful Facebook trolls who have bombarded her with messages calling her a 'bad mum' since the tragedy in January last year.

The insurance worker said: 'Something that has been difficult was the reports that Freddie was behind me (when it happened) and that was not true.

'I've had lots of hurtful comments and people Facebooking me, sending abusive messages that I was a bad mum.

'I see little kids a few steps in front or behind their parents every day.

'I have to live with what happened.

'I loved that little boy and I love Archie so much. Those kids were my world and I just never would have put them in harm's way.

'I just want people, before they start making nasty comments, to really think about how they are with their children and how they feel it is right to judge.

'It has been very hurtful and we have already gone through hell.'

Bristol Crown Court heard last week how the tow hitch between the Land Rover and the trailer was not secure because the position of its handbrake prevented it from being locked down.

Prosecutor Anna Vigars said Freddie had been walking behind his mother, playing in the puddles and laughing and joking when the accident happened.

They had just dropped off his brother at Parson Street Primary School when the portable cabin detached, travelling around 10 or 12 car lengths before mounting the pavement and crushing the toddler against a wall and telegraph pole.

The trailer is used on building sites as an area for workers to relax and contained a kitchen area with a table and basic facilities, as well as a toilet.

Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving but Freddie's family slammed the 'lenient' sentence and have started a petition to get mandatory safety checks for towing equipment.

When Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC handed Davies his sentence, Mr Hussey branded him a 'f****** joke' and called Davies a 'f****** t***'.

Mrs Hussey agreed, calling the sentence 'disgusting, no justice at all' before shouting at Davies: 'I hope you rot in hell. You are scum. He was a beautiful little boy.'

Mr Hussey revealed how he has suffered panic attacks since the tragedy and lost his HGV driving job because he cannot get behind the wheel.

Freddie's parents Scott and Donna Hussey denounced the sentence of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service given to Davies as a 'f****** joke'. They have set up a petition calling for tougher rules

Mrs Hussey (pictured left with her husband Scott) said she has received 'lots of hurtful messages' over the death of Freddie (right) who was killed in by the runaway trailer in Bedminster, Bristol in January last year

He said: 'If the law can change then that would be great it is not all for nothing, but we also want to get the sentence changed.

'We feel we have been wronged by the justice system.

'We thought we would get justice but we are back at day one again. It is hard and it feels the past 14 months have been for nothing.'

His wife added: 'Since the sentencing we feel we are back at day one again, we don't want to get out of bed and carry on.

'We feel like we lost our little boy for nothing.

'He was giggling at me and then out of nowhere the trailer came, it all happened so fast. I couldn't get to him in time and these moments will live with me forever.

'I saw things no one should ever see. I know we did nothing wrong but still go over what ifs.'

In a moving statement, she earlier described the impact on her family of Freddie's death, and said: 'We have all suffered with nightmares and flashbacks and we have had to put Archie to bed most nights crying as he is missing his little brother, his best friend and playmate and cannot comprehend how or why this has happened.

'Archie doesn't want to watch cartoons on Saturday morning any more, as this is something he used to do with Freddie.

'It is devastating as a parent when you have already lost one child and your other one talks about killing himself so he can be with his brother. He is only eight years old. What can you do or say?

'Archie and I have started therapy. I get flashbacks of the incident and events before and after every day. I have woken up at night screaming as I relive what happened in my dreams and it is terrifying.'

-----------------------------------------------
A heroic mother saved her daughter from the jaws of a 13ft crocodile in a 10-minute long battle, armed only with a wooden washing paddle.

Diwalinen Vankar, 58, had gone with her 19-year-old daughter Kanta, to the bank of the Vishwamitri River, 40 kilometres from Vadodara, in west India, to wash their clothes.

As they were wringing out their laundry, a mugger crocodile grabbed Kanta's right leg and dragged her into the murky river.

A crocodile grabbed Diwalinen Vankar's daughter's legs on the banks of the Vishwamitri River in west India and dragged her into the river - her mother rescued her by hitting it with a washing paddle (stock image)

The sudden attack rattled Vankar, who hastily grabbed her daughter's hand to try and pull her free from the clutches of the crocodile. 

But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. 

Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch.

'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' 

But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 

'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said.

'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go.

'It took me 10 minutes to finally free her from its jaws.'

Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village

After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged.

Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.'

She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return.  

A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river.  

'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India.

'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' 

Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the Vishwamitri River.

Prehistoric man sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave in modern day France 36,000 years ago.

Now, with the help of cutting-edge technology, those works of art in the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave have been reproduced to create the biggest replica cave in the world.

The manmade cavern named the Caverne du Pont-d'Arc has been built a few miles from the original site in Vallon-Pont-D'arc in Southern France and contains 1,000 painstakingly-reproduced drawings as well as around 450 bones and other features.

Cavemen and women sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave 36,000 years ago and now a replica has been created (pictured)

The replica cave (pictured) contains 1,000 painstakingly reproduced drawings, as well as bones and other debris

It contains pictures of oxen, cows, deer and other animals the original artists used as inspiration

The original and unique ‘Grotte Chauvet’ was discovered around 20 years ago and is a Unesco World Heritage Site.

It is the oldest known and the best preserved cave decorated by man, but is not open to the public and is only seen by a handful of experts every year, in order to keep the precious works of art safe.

Now experts have scanned the original drawings using 3D modelling techniques to capture each marking and position them correctly on the bumpy replica walls to the millimetres.

The replica cave (pictured) has been built near Vallon-Pont-D'arc in Southern France and contains 1,000 painstakingly-reproduced drawings of 425 animals as well as around 450 bones

It is the oldest cave decorated by man – and the best preserved, but is not open to the public to keep the precious works of art safe. It bears images of woolly rhinos for example (the replica drawings are shown)

‘The most remarkable paintings, engravings, palaeontological and essential geological representations are reproduced full-scale from the scanned originals,’ promotional material says.

‘The objective is to reproduce the emotions originally aroused by the cave and to reveal its hidden world.’

The drawings include images of 14 different species such as cave bears, woolly rhinoceros, mammoths and big cats, some of which are the only representations in Palaeolithic cave art.

Unique representations include a panther, owl and even part of the female body, making the original site an invaluable research subject for scientists around the world.

'The Decorated Cave of Pont-d’Arc is an invitation to a journey back in time, a wonderful dive into the heart of humanity and a major landmark in the history of civilisation,' said the creators of the replica

Creators added that one of their objectives was to reproduce the emotions aroused by the original cave

Unique representations include a panther, owl and even part of the female body, making the original site an invaluable research subject for scientists around the world. The panther is among these big cats

While the real cave is 91,490 square feet (8,500 metres) the replica is 32,290 square feet (3,000 square metres) in area. Here, copies of drawings can be seen on the ceiling

Visitors to the Caverne du Pont-d'Arc marvel at the replica cave, which is almost identical to the 36,000 year old Vallon-Pont-D'arc

The replica cave (pictured) will open to the public on April 25. Pictured is a drawing of a horse that adorns its roof

The replica cave reproduces the complex and turbulent works of art depicted in the Decorated Cave of Pont-d’Arc.

Specialists used 3D modelling and anamorphic techniques, the latter of which is used to shoot widescreen images.

Using a high-precision scanner, a three-dimensional digital model of the cave was created.

Experts first modelled the cave’s continuous surface and then made it fit the new space accordingly.

They took 6,000 digital photos of the artwork, allowing it to be copied accurately.

Images were placed on the corresponding computerised cave-walls before being transferred onto the physical replica.

The new cave also includes replica paw prints of  bears, bones and details preserved in the original cave.

But while the real cave is 91,490 square feet (8,500 metres) the replica is 32,290 square feet (3,000 square metres) in area and visitors to the attraction, which opens on April 25, will be able to take in the artwork while standing on a raised walkway.

Promotional material for the replica says: ‘Today, the bold alliance of artistic creation and the most advanced technologies, some of which were used for the first time, make of this replica a true prototype.

‘…The Decorated Cave of Pont-d’Arc is an invitation to a journey back in time, a wonderful dive into the heart of humanity and a major landmark in the history of civilisation.

‘Our ambition is to give visitors the opportunity to feel the same emotions, experience the same sensations and the surprise to discover a unique place in the world.’

Hervé Saulignac, President of the General Council of the Ardèche and Vice-President of the Rhône-Alpes Region, said: ‘36 000 years separate us from these men, highflying artists, who settled there, a few metres from a river that still defines our territory. 

'Almost everything is similar – nature - it has not aged.

‘Our ambition is that it should be the same. To preserve this masterpiece for future generations, to continue to make it indestructible, untouched by the ravages of man and time…’

The attraction, which has cost €55 million (£40 million or $60 million), also includes a discovery centre, which will inform visitors about the flora, fauna and daily lives of our ancestors who lived in the region 36,000 years ago.

Sketches of panthers adorn the wall of the replica cave, which cost £40million to create

It is the largest replica cave in the world and features a walkway from which visitors can view the reproduced sketches

Promotional material for the replica says: ‘Today, the bold alliance of artistic creation and the most advanced technologies, some of which were used for the first time, make of this replica a true prototype.' A reproduction of a sketch of a woolly rhino done 36,000 years ago, is shown

The replica cavern condenses 8,000 square metres of the original site into 3,000 square metres and contains more than 1,000 drawings

A visitor to the cave points at the animal drawings which were modelled identically on those discovered in southern France 20 years ago

Creators hope the replica will help preserve the masterpiece of original cave art discovered 20 years ago - which is only open to researchers

The attraction also includes a discovery centre, which will inform visitors about the flora, fauna and daily lives of our ancestors who lived in the region

The site is not just limited to artwork - pictured here are replicas of more than 450 bones found in the original Vallon-Pont-D'arc

A shocking video has emerged of ISIS thugs using sledgehammers and AK-47 rifles to destroy walls and statues in Iraq's UNESCO World Heritage city of Hatra.

In the slickly produced seven minute footage, jihadists are shown smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year old city. 

Militants are also recorded chipping away at the bases of some of the larger wall sculptures and cracking boulders into ancient city pillars, while eerie music plays in the background.

The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. 

Elsewhere in the clip, ISIS thugs balanced precariously on ladders use a hammer to bang repeatedly on the back of carved faces on the side of the ancient walls until they topple with a crash to the ground.  

They are also filmed blasting Kalashnikov rifles at artefacts in the city that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.

The footage was posted to a militant website frequently used by the terrorist organisation.  

ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. 

The fanatics claim ancient relics are 'false idols' which promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law.

Authorities also believe they have been sold on the black market to fund their atrocities.

The slickly produced seven minute clip begins with an aerial shot over the ancient site where relics have been destroyed by ISIS

Hatra, 68 miles southwest of ISIS-held city of Mosul, is 2,000 years old and is a UNESCO World Heritage site 

ISIS have destroyed ancient relics such as this in Hatra, as they violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law 

Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire.   

Pictured in civilian clothing, the ISIS thugs were seen overturning statues, destroying religious icons and replacing Christian crosses with the chilling ISIS banner.

Elsewhere, ISIS went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. 

The jihadists also bulldozed ruins in Hatra in March.  

ISIS have also set off bombs around Mosul Central Library, destroying as many as 10,000 priceless and irreplaceable books and manuscripts.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called the Nimrud attack 'a war crime.' 

Hatra, 68 miles southwest of the ISIS-held city of Mosul, was a large fortified city during the Parthian Empire and capital of the first Arab kingdom. 

It is home to numerous temples and sculptures dedicated to gods including Apollo and Poseidon. 

The video comes in the wake of a major blow for ISIS, with Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit falling into the hands of the Iraqi government. 

Tikrit is 80 miles north of Baghdad on the main highway to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. 

Meanwhile Isis has taken control of 90 per cent of a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus - only a few kilometres from Bashar al-Assad's stronghold. 

A human rights monitoring group claimed that the terror organisation almost has full control of the camp which has a population of 18,000 civilians. 

The United Nations said it was very concerned about the safety of the population. 

Chris Gunness of the UN Relief and Works agency said: 'The situation in Yarmouk is an affront to the humanity of all of us, a source of universal shame.

'Yarmouk is a test, a challenge for the international community. We must not fail. The credibility of the international system itself is at stake.' 

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights warned that the population of the camp are under threat of death from Isis, hunger and disease.

Hatra is 68 miles southwest of the city of Mosul.

It dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great. 

It is famous for its striking pillared temple at the centre of a sprawling archaeological site.  

The ancient city, a UNESCO world heritage site, is said to have withstood invasions by the Romans thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers.

A temple to the Shamash sun god still stands more than 1,750 years after the Sassanian empire razed the Mesopotamian city. 

The ancient trading centre in Hatra spanned 4 miles in circumference and was supported by more than 160 towers.

At its heart are a series of temples with a grand temple at the center — a structure supported by columns that once rose to 100 feet.

A litter of adorable baby foxes are being looked after they were discovered abandoned in a cardboard box in a car park in Pennsylvania.

The newborn cubs were discovered by a woman passing the car park, who noticed the box sitting next to a clothing donation bin.

When she peeped inside she saw seven baby foxes – thought to be only 10 days old – sitting together.

Scroll down for video 

The baby foxes are being looked after after they were discovered in a cardboard box, left by a clothing donation bin in a car park 

The seven cubs weighed around six ounces each when they were taken in by the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center

Three of the rescued red foxes rest with a cuddly toy. Once they have grown and gained strength they will be released back into the wild

The cubs were taken to the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center in Stroudsbury, where they are now being cared for.

Katherine Uhler, director of the center, said the little creatures -  five males and two females - were healthy but dehydrated when they arrived.

She said: ‘They came in at about six ounces each.

‘There are five males, also known as dogs, and two girls known as vixens.

‘We know they're red foxes because even though they're not red yet, they still have this little white tail.’

The center is spending more than $1,000 looking after the foxes, who are being bottle-fed special 'fox milk' and formula.

Ms Uhler added: ‘We had to give them rabies vaccinations and feed them fox milk.

'We gave them Pedialyte fluids first then mixed a quart of Fox Valley formula which is designed specifically for baby wild foxes. 

Vets at the center said they know the cubs are red foxes - among the most common of the species in America - because of their white tales

 ‘We bottle feed them until they are a little bigger, then they'll start feeding out of the bowl.

‘When they're finished feeding out of the bowl then we'll start feeding them what they eat in the wild which is meat, and some vegetables and fruits.’

The pack will be returned back to the wild in July. 

It is costing the center in Pennsylvania more than $1,000 to take care of the group, which includes  five male and two female red foxes

The tiny animals were vaccinated against rabies and have been bottle-fed milk to build them up, before they will start feeding from a bowl

Little girl , who appears to be around six or seven , sits behind large machine gun . Tells man she is ` shooting at Daesh ' , the Arabic name for ISIS . Claims she has killed 400 of the extremists so far , before firing several rounds . As she fires the gun , he says : ` Kill , kill ' , according to Vocativ . com
-----------------------------------------------
This is the shocking moment a young Kurdish girl fires a machine gun at ISIS, before boasting she has killed 400 of the Islamic militants - as she is egged on with cries of 'kill, kill'.

The little girl, who appears to be around six or seven, is shown sitting on a ridge in her bright pink jumper and trainers, just behind the large machine gun.

She chats away to a man behind the camera, telling him she is 'shooting at Daesh' in Kurdish - before firing several rounds into the desert. 

Shocking: The little girl claims she is firing the machine gun at 'Daesh', the Arabic name for ISIS

Kill: She tells the man she has killed 400 of the extremists so far, as he encourages her to kill more

Target: However, it is unclear exactly what the girl is shooting at in the minute-long video

The man asks her how many ISIS fighters she has killed so far, and she holds up four fingers while boasting '400'.

As she fires the gun, and, according to Vocativ.com, he says: 'Kill, kill.'

However, whether she has actually hit anything is unclear. 

The video - entitled Young YPG Girl Shoots PK Machine Gun - was posted in January, but has only recently emerged on social networks.

YPG is the acronym for the People's Protection Unit, which has been battling ISIS since the extremists rise to power last year.

But while ISIS are known for using young recruits to carry out executions, fight and even become suicide bombers, the Kurds have so far kept their children out of the battle.

Propaganda: ISIS are known to use children in videos like this one, where they are being trained as fighters

Sickening: In more horrific videos, ISIS have claimed to be using children as executioners

Feared: The Kurdish are famous for their female fighters, who have been key to driving ISIS out 

Rumours: ISIS fighters believe if they are killed by a woman they won't get their virgins in the afterlife

One of the most horrifying videos released by the Islamists showed a young boy seeming to execute a so-called spy. 

They have also released a video of dozens of 'child soldiers' from Kazakhstan, apparently being trained to fight against ISIS enemies.

Instead, they are famous for their female recruits: it has proved to be one of their strengths against the militants, as they appear to believe if they are killed by a woman they will not be rewarded with 72 virgins in the afterlife.

As a result ISIS fighters have been reluctant to enter battles with the Women's Protection Units, or YPJ, reportedly leading to descent within the ranks of the terrorists and hastening their retreat from battles in places like Kobane.

Mister Money is now putting his money where his mouth is.

Floyd Mayweather has commissioned a mouthguard not only imbedded with his usual diamond and gold bling but stuffed with $100 bills.

Total cost, according to his favourite website TMZ, is $25,000.

Floyd Mayweather works in his gym as the fight with Pacquiao draws closer 

As the value of the richest fight of all time keeps rising ever closer to the half-billion mark, so does the value of Manny Pacquiao’s target.

If the PacMan does land the knockout blow, then given the expensive protection at least the Money Man should wake up smiling.

Mayweather has just spent $300,000 on yet another vehicle, according to his favourite website TMZ. This is a Mercedes ‘Land Yacht’ people carrier to which he has added such extras as a 55-inch television and a champagne bar, to turn it into what he calls his ‘Party Bus.’ 

And so it turns out that all the time Andre Ward was talking about coming to England for a rematch with Carl Froch he was setting up yet another easy night out in his own backyard.

Only a couple of days after the self-called Son of God declared he would be prepared to cross the Atlantic to face the Cobra, Ward revealed that his overdue ring comeback will be taking place in his California hometown on June 20.

The opponent? Most likely a certain Marco Antonio Periban, who turned up in questionable condition to face James DeGale and was promptly knocked out in that final eliminator for Andre Dirrell’s IBF super-middleweight title.

So much for wanting to do it a second time with Froch to unify the WBA’s two world championship belts. That fight had been ordered by the WBA and Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn did his best to come to terms before the March 31 deadline

Now Ward’s announcement has made it yet more likely that Froch might retire.

Ward had claimed a readiness to overcome his phobia – either fear of flying or of fighting abroad.

He wouldn’t go as far as Froch’s home city of Nottingham but he did express a willingness to travel to London for a showdown at either Wembley or the 02.

His argument was that his US victory over Froch in the final of the Super Six super-middleweight tournament took place in Atlantic City, not Oakland.

So London would be fairer than Nottingham.

Still, Froch doubted he was serious and was apparently right to do so.

It is back to home sweet home for Ward, at the Oracle Arena across the bay from San Francisco.

If not exactly the offspring of the Almighty, Ward is a favourite son of American boxing. So the WBA appear compliant, with no sign yet of him being stripped of his belt.

Foch is unlikely to get his dream fight against Ward or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr

Ward remains atop the ratings as their ‘super’ champion, with Froch still the ‘regular’ world titlist.

Maybe the WBA are giving him license to shake off the ring rust after being out of the ring since his points win over another undistinguished foe, Edwin Rodriguez, way back in November 2013.

Yet Ward’s inactivity has long since become more a result of self-inflicted promotional disputes than his original injury.

Now he is the first major signing by the new kids on that block, the music industry-backed Roc Nation, who are trying to confirm not only the opponent for June 20 but a TV deal.

That the television rights have not been snapped up instantly by either of the major networks HBO or Showtime speaks to Ward’s sluggish box office appeal despite the high professional regard for his skills.

The closest he has come to properly fighting abroad has been a couple of low-key outings to the Caribbean. That he so much as contemplated travelling several thousand miles to face Froch indicates a realisation that he could make a lot more money in England.

Still, that temptation is not enough.

Not yet, anyway. He carries on talking about the Cobra later. But as it stands one of Froch’s dreams for his farewell appearance – boxing at the City Ground home of Nottingham Forest – has been dashed.

The other ambition – a fight in Las Vegas – hangs on Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr coming through an interim bout and agreeing to meet him there in September.

But Froch says: ‘Unless I get a fight that excites me soon I may well hang up the gloves.’

Ward, meanwhile, talks about meeting the challenge of middleweight KO sensation Gennady Golovkin ‘soon'.

Floyd Mayweather says: ‘For me, Andre beats him every day of the week.'

The questions, Andre, are which day? And where?

The IBF still insist that Amir Khan, who has yet to confirm Chris Algieri or anyone else as his May 30 opponent, turned down a fight with Tim Bradley as a final eliminator for Kell Brook’s world welterweight title.

One question for the IBF:

Why would Khan bother with an eliminator when Brook is gagging to meet him in a Battle of Britain?

Amir Khan's proposed fight with Chris Algieri is yet to be confirmed

Post Office asked accountants to investigate Horizon IT system in 2012 . Follows complaints from dozens of subpostmasters who said they had been wrongly accused of theft , fraud and false accounting . Leaked report suggests discrepancies could have been caused by computer failures , cyber criminals or human error .
-----------------------------------------------
The Post Office failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters, a report revealed yesterday.

Many were sacked, stripped of their savings and even jailed after cash shortfalls were recorded at some branches – despite claims that a faulty IT system was to blame.

The Post Office asked forensic accountants Second Sight to investigate the Horizon IT system in 2012, following complaints from dozens of subpostmasters who said they had been wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting when cash shortfalls were discovered.

The Post Office failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters, a report has revealed (file picture)

Now a leaked copy of the accountants’ independent report has suggested that the discrepancies could have been caused by computer failures, cyber criminals or human error.

It also accused the Post Office of failing ‘in many cases’ to identify ‘the root cause of shortfalls’ before starting civil or criminal proceedings.

The review said some criminal cases brought by the Post Office were ‘motivated primarily’ by a desire to recover the money and did not appear to be supported by sufficient evidence.

It went on to claim that the Post Office had failed to provide the accountancy firm with the documentation they required, and had ‘terminated’ their contract before they finished their research.

The report has sparked fresh calls for a full independent inquiry into the computer system used by postmasters after the report reported concerns that ‘in some circumstances Horizon can be systemically flawed’.

 Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot said some subpostmasters had been 'dragged through the mud'

Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot, who led an MPs’ campaign to support the subpostmasters, said: ‘These people have been pillars of the community who had their reputations dragged through the mud – some have been sent to prison, they’ve been made bankrupt, they’ve had contracts terminated, I understand at least one has committed suicide. And the way they have been treated is an utter disgrace. I think there needs to be an independent inquiry.’

Responding to the report, the Post Office said the review had repeated ‘complaints made by a very small number of former postmasters, as well as a number of assertions and opinions’ – but had not offered any new evidence to support the claims.

They pointed out that they have received 150 complaints about the IT system since it opened a complaints system two years ago, a number they said represents a ‘tiny fraction’ of the 500,000 people who had used the system ‘effectively’.

A spokesman said: ‘In none of Post Office’s own work, nor through any of Second Sight’s work, has any information emerged to suggest that a conviction is unsafe.’

But Andy Furey, of the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘This is another damning report which reiterates the serious concerns of many postmasters. Part of the problem throughout has been the bullish behaviour of the Post Office towards postmasters who feel that they are helpless victims of a computer system gone wrong.’

Sacked: Subpostmaster Michael Rudkin, 57

A subpostmaster was pursued to the brink of ruin and his wife left contemplating suicide after being prosecuted by the Post Office.

Michael Rudkin, 57, believes action was taken against him after he allegedly discovered that data in branches could be altered remotely – potentially explaining mystery cash shortfalls.

The day after Mr Rudkin expressed concern at the revelation, a Post Office auditor turned up at his shop in Ibstock, Leicestershire, to tell him £44,000 was unaccounted for. ‘My world was turned upside down,’ he said, adding: ‘I became like a drowning man with no life raft.’

Despite insisting he never saw a penny of the ‘missing’ funds, Mr Rudkin was forced to repay the money and his wife Susan, 60, who did most of the day-to-day running of the branch, was prosecuted and given a suspended prison sentence.

Mr Rudkin had his contract terminated while his wife was left ‘contemplating suicide’ after her conviction.

The Altamura Man became the oldest Neanderthal to have his DNA extracted by researchers . Scientists in southern Italy have known about him since 1993 . Calcite pebbles line the Neanderthal 's eye sockets , nose bone and an upper jaw like a hundred decorative piercings .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)About 150,000 years ago -- give or take 20,000 -- a guy fell into a well. Last month he made science history.

The Altamura Man became the oldest Neanderthal to have his DNA extracted by researchers. It took them more than 20 years to get around to doing it.

Scientists in southern Italy have known about him since 1993, when spelunkers spied his skull staring blankly back at them from its nook in the Lamalunga cave, deep under the town of Altamura.

The cave explorers told researchers at the University of Bari what they'd found, according to their report published in March in the Journal of Human Evolution and Phys.org.

Altamura Man's intact skull and jumbled pile of bones made for a great specimen, but they were wedged into a panoply of stalactites and stony globules deposited by water dripping over them for tens of thousands of years.

Researchers decided not to rescue the bones for fear that trying to ease them out of the cave's calcified grip would shatter them and ruin Altamura Man. So, they left him forever a cave man.

Calcite pebbles line the Neanderthal's eye sockets, nose bone and an upper jaw like a hundred decorative piercings. Analysis of the calcite has shown the bones to be 128,000 to 187,000 years old.

Scientists believe Altamura Man wound up in the cave at least that long ago after falling into a prehistoric well, then died in the caverns at its bottom of thirst or hunger.

Recently, researchers made an exception, and toted off a chip from his right shoulder blade to the lab. Metrics taken of his skeleton confirm Altamura Man was a Homo neanderthalensis.

He will spend perhaps endless eons glaring silently out of his cranny in the world's most secluded spot, or, as Altamura's archeological museum describes it, "in the corner of a small cavity situated between the ground and the back wall."

The scientists hope they will be able to sequence his DNA, to find out more about the evolution of all hominids -- including us.

And to hear some of Altamura Man's story about life in Neanderthals' early days in Europe, before he happened to stumble into that darned hole.

Haley Mulholland became suspicious husband Kevin was having an affair . The mother-of-eight monitors her husband 's movements , checks his phone and even sniffs him to see if she can smell another woman 's perfume . Despite his infidelity , Haley and Kevin still share a house in Bristol .
-----------------------------------------------
A wife has told how she has put her husband on a lifelong sex ban and tracks his every move, after discovering he had cheated on her after taking a lie detector test.

Despite his infidelity, Haley and Kev Mulholland still share a house in Bristol, though Mr Mulholland has to sleep on the living room sofa.

The mother-of-eight says that while she does not want her husband, she does not want any other woman to have him either.

Haley Mulholland became suspicious husband Kevin was having an affair after reading his Facebook page

Mrs Mulholland monitors her husband’s movements, checks his phone and even sniffs him to see if she can smell another woman’s perfume.

'I might not want Kev, but I don’t want anyone else to have him either,' said the 45 year old, who is mum to Sophie, 27, Kerrie, 25, Kasey, 14, Brittany, 13, Paige ten, Tyler, nine, Madison, eight and five-year-old Alexius.

'I keep tabs on his phone and on his Facebook page. He swears he’s staying true, but I couldn’t trust him as far as I could throw him. Over the past few months I’ve become quite the detective.'

Though Mrs Mulholland has so far found no evidence to suggest he is straying, she refuses to take her husband of 15 years back.

She said: 'While we’re not divorced, we’re not together. There’s no kissing, sex or anything like that, though Kev’s tried his luck.

'He creeps into my room saying the sofa’s given him a bad back and that he needs to sleep in my bed. I just tell him where to go.

Kevin and Haley, who have been together for 15 years, are pictured on their wedding day

'The other night he started stroking my thigh. I slapped his hand away. This body is well and truly out of bounds.'

The Mulhollands' marriage became rocky shortly before they renewed their wedding vows on Valentine’s Day in 2013.

Mrs Mulholland said: 'A month before the big day I was on the computer and noticed Facebook was still logged on to Kev’s profile.

'I clicked on his inbox, and discovered a message from one of our neighbours.

'She’d written "Have you told her yet?" which made my heart race.

'Had my Kev been going round for more than a cup of sugar?

'The rest of their correspondence was harmless enough, so I decided to give Kev the benefit of the doubt.

'But just weeks after our wedding I started hearing rumours about the two of them.

'I asked Kev if something was going on and he denied it. But I smelt a rat - a love rat.'

That is when Mrs Mulholland started to doubt her husband and put him on a sex ban until he admitted the truth.

She said: 'I trusted the people who were telling me. So I told him, no nookie until I get to the bottom it.

'Two years went by and I stuck to my word. We slept on opposite sides of the bed, absolutely no touching.

Haley says she has banished Kevin to the sofa after learning that he cheated and has also imposed a sex ban

'By the end Kev was so desperate for some hanky panky he suggested we went on the Jeremy Kyle show for a lie detector test.

'I booked for us to go on the show. A couple of nights later I checked Kev’s Facebook inbox and felt sick to my stomach.

'There were loads of messages from this other woman. She had written that she was worried she’d caught an STI from Kev. It was absolutely disgusting.'

Mrs Mulholland went round to confront her neighbour who claimed her Facebook had been hacked.

But the lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle show revealed that Mr Mulholland had cheated on his wife with their neighbour.

She said: 'Kev walked off stage, swearing that the results were fixed. But that evening he finally admitted the truth.

'He said it had only lasted five minutes, but that didn’t matter to me. Once a cheat always a cheat.

'I knew we were over but I didn’t kick him out for the sake of the kids, instead I moved him downstairs.

'The little ones are none the wiser.'

Mrs Mulholland said she has now started to track her husband’s movements to make sure he isn’t seeing other women.

'It sounds crazy as, hand on my heart, I do not want him back. But whenever he goes out I make a note of how long for and calculate what he could be doing,' she said.

In happier times: Haley and Kevin who is father to six of her eight children

'Maybe it’s jealousy or perhaps it’s because I want him to suffer.

'I know his Facebook password and I log in most days to check whether his floozy has been in touch.

'She’s kept quiet, and if she has any sense she’ll continue to do so.'

It’s not just technology Mrs Mulholland uses to try and catch her husband out.

'The other day I hugged him as soon as he walked through the door. I think he saw it as progress, but I was just seeing if I could smell another woman on him.

'I make sure I know where he is at all times.

'So far he has passed the test, but if he ever fails I’m ready to pounce.'

Mr Mulholland, who is unable to work due to a bad back, has told his wife he will win her back by remaining celibate until she changes her mind.

He claims he’ll show he’s remained faithful by doing another lie detector test.

Haley Mulholland says she now keeps tabs on her husband and checks his Facebook page 

Mrs Mulholland said: 'I don’t know what I’d do if the results came back and he’s telling the truth. Maybe I’d take him back, maybe I wouldn’t.

'For now I’m happy being single. I don’t see a man in my future and I’ll be damned if there’s a woman in Kevin’s.

'He’s made his bed and he has to lie in it – alone.'

Mr Mulholland, 46, said he was determined to win his wife back. 

'I love Haley more than anything, no other woman compares. The kids and her are my life.

'I’m still living in the house, so there’s still love there. I’m not having sex with anyone to prove just how serious I am.

'The fact that she’s checking up on me tells me that she cares.'

-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)A New York City detective has been suspended after being accused of stealing $3,000 during an illegal cigarettes raid, according to police spokesman Stephen Davis.

Surveillance video obtained by CNN affiliate News 12 Brooklyn appears to show Det. Ian Cyrus stashing cash in a bag before leaving the Yemen Deli and Grocery store in Brooklyn last Friday.

The detectives had arrested two employees for selling loose cigarettes, according to News 12 Brooklyn.

Ali Abdullah, the store's manager, noticed the money was gone from a box, but assumed it was taken by one of his employees. When he checked the cameras he couldn't believe what he saw, he told News 12 Brooklyn.

Cyrus, who is under investigation by the internal affairs bureau, could not be reached for comment.

His supervisor Sgt. Fritz Glemaud, who was heading the raid, was placed on modified duty, Davis said.

Argentina says it will mount a legal challenge -- but has ruled out another conflict . Daniel Filmus said Britain 's decision to increase military spending was ` gunboat diplomacy ' He said : ` The United Kingdom can count on Argentina as an ally '
-----------------------------------------------
Argentina has branded British attempts to explore the seas around the Falklands Islands for oil ‘illegitimate’ and says it will mount a legal challenge – but has ruled out another conflict.

Daniel Filmus, Argentina’s secretary of state for the islands, told an event in London that Britain’s decision to increase military spending in the South Atlantic was ‘gunboat diplomacy’.

Mr Filmus said military conflict ‘belongs to the past’ and claimed: ‘The United Kingdom can count on Argentina as an ally.’

Argentina has branded British attempts to explore the seas around the Falklands Islands for oil ‘illegitimate’

But he added: ‘The unilateral and illegitimate appropriation of non-renewable natural resources that is being carried out by the UK in the South Atlantic has been the subject of continued protest by the Argentine Republic.

‘Argentina has been forced to resort to defensive measures,’ he said, using ‘the law and political action as its main tools in order to protect the natural resources in the area under dispute’.

He said Argentinian judicial authorities would consider the case against British companies involved in the oil exploration.

Addressing the question of possible future conflict, Mr Filmus said: ‘Argentina bears no grudge against the inhabitants of the islands in spite of all the manoeuvres designed to prove otherwise. 

'What Argentina is not going to do is give in. We do not wish to spend another penny on arms. It is through negotiations that we will solve this. 

'We do not know how many years it will take... But what justification can there be for mothers crying over the deaths of their sons? It really must be dialogue.’

Daniel Filmus's comments sparked a furious reaction from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured)

Mr Filmus’s comments sparked a furious reaction from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who told Sky News: ‘It is an outrageous piece of bullying and threatening against the Falkland islanders’ perfect right to develop their own economic resources and Argentina needs to stop this kind of behaviour and start acting like a responsible member of the international community.’

Britain defeated Argentina in a 1982 war over the South Atlantic islands and administers them as an overseas territory, whose population of around 3,000 voted overwhelmingly to remain under British rule in a referendum in 2013.

Argentina says it is the rightful owner of the islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, a claim dating back centuries to the Spanish colonial era. The dispute has escalated in recent years with the discovery of oil and gas deposits.

-----------------------------------------------
Toby Perkins, deputy chairman of the Labour election campaign, revealed in an email that his interns are paid just £4 per day for 12-hour shifts

Labour has been accused of 'utter hypocrisy' after it was revealed interns working for one of their election chiefs are paid just £4 per day while the party claims to champion the low paid.

An email sent by Toby Perkins, who is deputy chairman of the Labour election campaign as well as MP for Chesterfield, revealed that interns are paid just £25 per week for working 12-hour days.

Now Labour is trying to get around the problem by saying the interns will be paid nothing at all, making them volunteers rather than workers.

The email, published in The Sun, reveals that alongside their measly wage, interns could expect to be reimbursed for travel, as well as being put up in accommodation during the campaign.

Mr Perkins had last week denied employing any interns, despite advertising for five 'enthusiastic, motivated and hard-working Campaign Interns' online on March 8.

The advert, which says the interns will be paid for travel, food and accommodation, adds: 'This is an excellent opportunity to receive training in and get first hand experience of Labour Campaigns, as part of a driven and highly motivated team.' 

Labour's 2015 manifesto has sought to champion working-class Britons by increasing the minimum wage to £8 per hour, promoting the Living Wage, and banning zero-hours contracts. 

Julia Cambridge, who is running against Mr Perkins in Chesterfield, said: 'This smacks of utter hypocrisy.

'You can't one day bang on about giving workers a living wage, and then do the exact opposite.'

Mr Perkins, who was first elected MP in 2010, is defending a narrow majority of just 500 votes over the Lib Dems in Chesterfield.

He said that the email, entitled 'The Interns Are Coming' was intended to drum up support and give the impression campaigners are working hard.

In a statement he added: 'The people working on my election campaign are doing so in a voluntary capacity.

'Two of the volunteers are students on four-year politics degrees who have during their third year been based in my office in Westminster and wanted to volunteer in the General Election campaign.

'The other two are local young party members who were between jobs and were wanting to dedicate themselves to the General election campaign.

'The local party arranged to cover their expenses.'

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has heaped praise upon Loic Remy after the striker scored his second consecutive winner in the 2-1 victory over Stoke on Saturday.

Remy's goal meant Mourinho's side took another step towards securing the Premier League title with  three points, despite an injury to Diego Costa.

Costa hobbled off 10 minutes after replacing Oscar at half-time, with another hamstring problem leaving him set for a spell on the sidelines.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho praised the professionalism and scoring ability of Remy

But Mourinho refused to let the injury dampen the significance of the win, instead lauding Remy's scoring instincts after the forward also netted the decisive strike when Chelsea beat Hull 3-2 in their last game before the international break.

'When Eden (Hazard) recovered the ball from a loose throw from Asmir Begovic, you could see immediately Remy sprinted to score what I call an easy goal, but I love strikers to score easy goals,' Mourinho said. 

'The tap-in when the goalkeeper has an incomplete save, attacking the ball on a low cross, rebounds - I love the easy goals from a striker.

Remy (centre) also netted Chelsea's winner against Hull before the international break

Mourinho said Remy has already made a crucial contribution to Chelsea despite not playing too often

'Remy keeps himself in great condition, even without having played many minutes, to be ready for us.

'He's a great boy and his contribution is already crucial, with these two match-winners in the last two matches.'

A Brazilian model who shot to fame after winning the Miss BumBum contest in 2014 has sparked outrage by posting a snap of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary to her Instagram account, along with a special Easter prayer.

Indianara Carvalho, 23 - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time all over again with ‘someone special' - accompanied the racy photo with the phrase: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength.'

The image, just one of a series of nude body-painted shots she shared over the Easter weekend, attracted more than 750 'likes', as well as a tirade of disapproval from her followers over its sacrilegious nature.

'Don’t mix God with your ridiculous shame and profanity,' wrote one Instagram user, Eliane Paz Salinas, of the portraits, which were created by Brazilian artist Binho over a marathon ten-hour spray can session.  

Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma, ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.'

Janvier Veliz Angulo concurred, stating: 'This proves that beauty is not everything … you have lost me as one of your fans.'

Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!'

Faith: Miss Carvalho, pictured in other poses from the same shoot, had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time all over again with ‘someone special'

Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census.  

Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth.

'May your blessings fill my spirit and my heart, which is so kind and cheerful... Feel your sweet and gentle presence... I am your grace.'

The buxom blonde triumphed in Brazil's annual bottom beauty contest last year, which sees 27 women - one from each state - complete to prove their backside is best.

Shortly afterwards, she underwent 'vaginal rejuvenation surgery' which includes a hymenoplasty, in order to bring 'respect' to her BumBum title, and to use her newly virginal status to find love.

Miss Carvalho, pictured mid-workout, said last year that by re-becoming a virgin, she hopes to bring 'a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title'

The procedure, which is not available in the UK, can be done by using surgical gel to create a new hymen that lasts a few days before dissolving, or more permanently by using a flap of skin cut from the vaginal wall.

Women undergoing the latter treatment must abstain from sex for at least three months after undergoing the procedure.

According to the New York Daily News, Miss Carvalho said: 'I wanted to undergo surgery to reconstruct my virginity before I have new photographs done.

'I wouldn't feel good about appearing naked if I wasn't exactly as I came into the world if you know what I mean. 

'I think I also want to give a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title by being a virgin.'

Magistrates heard the couple caused unnecessary suffering to some of the dogs by failing to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails.

Mrs Mazan, 53, who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years, chose not to give evidence at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court during the two-day trial.

Her husband Gary, 51, who is a long-distance lorry driver, claimed it was Mrs Mazan who had sole responsibility for the dogs. 

Crammed: The animals were found with matted fur and inside cramped, filthy cages inside a garden shed 

Seized: RSPCA inspectors discovered the animals in some of the 'worst conditions' they had ever seen

Owner: Mrs Mazan, who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years, chose not to give evidence at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court during the two-day trial

The animals had been kept at the family's home since they moved from Leeds to Bradford in February 2013.

A month after the move the RSPCA served a warning notice due to the conditions the dogs were being kept in, which had been adhered to by the time they visited again in April 2013.

But concerns over the welfare of the animals were raised by a dog warden after they were refused access to the property and called the RSPCA.  

Emma Ellis, an RSPCA inspector for Bradford who attended the scene and helped to seize the animals, said it was the worst conditions she has seen in her 12 years as an inspector.

She said: 'To see 12 dogs living in a small shed, with three fully grown setters living in a puppy cage is horrific. 

'They could not sit down or turn around and there fur was matted, covered in urine and faeces.

'When the shed was opened, the smell literally hit you and it was a small like I had never experienced before. I still recall the smell every time I see the photos.

Matted: The couple were said to have caused unnecessary suffering to the dogs as they failed to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails (pictured)

'To keep animals in these conditions is unacceptable for anyone, let a alone a dog breeder.'

The animals are now currently under the care of the RSPCA, after the charity demanded ownership of all the Mazans' pets, including an additional dog, called Clever.

The dog, which belonged to the family's daughter who was away at university, had been chipped in Mrs Mazan's name and magistrates decided to transfer custody of the animal, alongside the other 14 dogs, to the RSPCA.

Dingle Clark, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, told the court that boarding costs for the dogs since they were seized had reached £48,000, with an additional £7,000 in vets fees. 

Filthy: Three of the fully grown dogs were found by RSPCA inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed. All animals are now in the charity's care

Sentencing the pair to 26 weeks in jail, Allie Coward, chairman of the bench, said: 'We have considered all the evidence, and this was the most heinous act of cruelty against defenceless animals we have ever seen.'

An immediate appeal against the sentence was made and a request for bail ahead of any appeal hearing at the Crown Court, but the application for bail was denied by the court. 

The pair were also given a lifetime ban against owning or keeping any animal, and told they cannot appeal against the order for at least 25 years.

Nico Rosberg is locked in the battle of his career with Lewis Hamilton . Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race . Rosberg 's deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday . He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points .
-----------------------------------------------
Nico Rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career.

Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock, he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton: ‘I know exactly how he is functioning. I understand him really, really well. All his attitudes. I can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing. Sometimes he annoys me. Some character traits.’

Go on, then, tell us what it is that gets under your skin.

Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday 

Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton

Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign 

‘I don’t want to give details,’ says Rosberg, diplomatic to the core.

At this point the door of the Mercedes hospitality area, in which Rosberg and I are sitting alone, opens fast and loudly. It is Hamilton invading the quiet of the interview. He turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut, his head down, and shouts in an almost childlike way: ‘Phew, phew, man, it’s hot,’ deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke.

‘You see...?’ says Rosberg, his eyebrows arched.

The daunting task he faces against his extraordinary team-mate was made vividly clear under the lights in qualifying for Sunday’s Bahrain Grand Prix. Not only will he start behind Hamilton for the fourth consecutive race but behind the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, who is emerging as a putative title contender.

ROSBERG'S CORNER  

Keke Rosberg

The 1982 world champion attended pre-season testing with friends but rarely goes to races and does not give interviews. Nico said he got his father’s advice before the last race in Abu Dhabi but he generally gives his son space.

Vivian Rosberg

Nico’s long-term girlfriend turned wife. She attends a few races, sometimes with a clutch of their long-standing friends, but is happy in the background. She works as an interior designer.

Georg Nolte

A popular, mild-mannered former Bild sports journalist, who is Nico’s PR and Man Friday.

Tony Ross

Rosberg’s race engineer. His attachment to Rosberg is such that he moved from Williams to Mercedes at the driver’s request.

HAMILTON'S CORNER  

Anthony Hamilton

Father is rarely seen at races since being dropped as Lewis’s manager but he is still the family patriarch. He established the business side of his son’s career and still controls elements of it.

Niki Lauda

The Mercedes chairman is strictly neutral but has a vested interest in Hamilton being successful, having brought him to the team after telling the board he was the driver who could win them the title.

Daniel ‘Spinz’ Forrest

Hamilton’s new travelling companion. A music producer, he looks after Hamilton’s social media output.

Peter Bonnington

Hamilton’s race engineer. He did the same job for Michael Schumacher. 

Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday. He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points. But even more separates them as people.

Rosberg grew up the son of privilege. His father, Keke, was 1982 world champion. He was brought up in Monaco. He attended a smart international school there. He speaks five languages. But his life is the quiet life. Not for him the Hamilton whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in Los Angeles. He is not tattooed from chest to leg.

While Hamilton courts fame, Rosberg’s dream evening finishes with him and wife, Vivian, staying in to watch an ‘educational documentary’, their yellow Labrador, Bailey, at their side. Family is important. He has known Vivian, an interior designer, since his teenage years. They make smoothies or ‘healthy’ pancakes when they home in Monaco or Ibiza. They gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden.

He relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch. He loves his classic car — a light blue Mercedes 280SL Pagoda, as perfect as the day it was made in 1970. He bought it without Vivian knowing, but they both enjoy it now. He drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern France.

Rosberg has a trait rare among modern Formula One drivers: a hinterland. He turned down a place at Imperial College to become a full-time racing driver. If he wins the World Championship this year he will do so with a book under his arm. He is the driver who never stops learning.

Having married last year, he and Vivian are expecting their first child in August, during the sport’s summer break. ‘Typical German precision,’ he jokes. ‘I’m very excited and very lucky,’ he says. ‘I just hope it all goes well. There is a link between your personal life and your racing life, naturally.’ 

But we know he is a nice, intelligent chap, more settled in life than his rival. The point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity — the skill and cutting edge — to beat such an extravagant talent as Hamilton, who eclipsed him last year.

Rosberg has failed to match Hamilton this season, raising the question whether he will go the way of Mark Webber, who fell away after making his Red Bull team-mate Vettel fight him for his first title.

Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second in qualifying on Saturday 

Jenson Button will start his 100th race for McLaren from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying.

It was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure, the latest coming just four corners into his first lap.

‘It was a power cut,’ said Button. ‘I don’t know where it came from.' 

It is Rosberg who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later — and always turns up on time, unlike Hamilton — but genius sometimes makes its own rules. Raw talent is outstripping endeavour.

As a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on Friday, he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in. He arrived after a brief stop in Dubai, relaxing and training, before heading to the track to face an inquisition. Why had he criticised Hamilton for slowing down seven days ago in China and thus imperilling Mercedes’ one-two finish? Rosberg answered in a relaxed and courteous manner.

‘Only today have there been millions of questions,’ he tells me once the wider interrogation was over. ‘Other than that I’ve had some distance from it all. I don’t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine. For both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic.

Hamilton and Rosberg pose together during their unveiling as Mercedes' new team in February 2013 

‘Lewis and I are going through a difficult period. We cannot totally be friends. We go through ups and downs. We are only speaking when we need to but sometimes we have a laugh together. We have so much to do with each other. We karted together. We are here together. I am not an ice man, either. Things can get to me but I do not get angry. I am rational. You won’t catch me getting very emotional.’

The feud between the two has been running for a year, each upsetting the other in turn, a situation magnified because there has been nobody else with whom to scrap. If Ferrari seriously push their way into the championship contest, that might change somewhat.

‘There are so many experiences that I can build on,’ says Rosberg. ‘Even now when he has taken quite a few points off me and been on a winning streak, I think back to last year when I had my best run after he had won four in a row.

Nico's father Keke (left) was also a famous racing driver and won the 1982 Formula One World Championship 

‘I like to push myself. I am not at my peak as a driver, though I am probably close to it. But I have the experience of how to set up the car and deal with the whole world of Formula One. The intra-team stuff, personal relations are helped by last year. It was so valuable.’

Rosberg was born 29 years ago in Wiesbaden, Germany to a German mother, Sina, and his famous Finnish father. He soon moved to Monaco and developed as European polyglot. His solid family background is the bedrock of his life. Hamilton said last year that Rosberg was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds, the former being from a council estate in Stevenage and the latter from a plutocrat’s playground.

Fair? ‘I had it easy if you think of people who have money struggles in their lives. People reading this may think I had it easy. But I had my personal battles. Even making it to Formula One was not easy; it was a constant challenge and commitment. My whole life has taken a lot of sacrifice.

‘Some people say I am not strong enough to beat Lewis but I have as much belief as ever. I only wouldn’t believe I could beat him if I got to the end of the championship and I had lost. That is not what I want to happen and I am constantly learning to make sure it’s not what happens.’ 

Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel pipped Rosberg to second in qualifying on Saturday

A dentist who pulled out a man's teeth to try and cure his erectile dysfunction has been ordered to pay 20,000 euros (£14,000) in compensation.

The patient - known only as Alex S - had all 19 of his teeth removed over four weeks in Munich, Germany, and was charged 2,000 euros (£1,435).

He believed the series of operations would help him regain his vitality and also cure his schizophrenia.

The dentist - known only as K - claimed to be a 'recognised healer' and said he helped the 'spiritual self-healing capabilities of his patients'. 

It is thought he believed the operation would help cure Mr S, The Local reported. 

In a letter to his lawyer K claimed that he had  healed the patient by removing his 'poisonous' teeth - adding that the patient was 'not psychotic' but 'marvellous'. 

But in court K said he pulled the teeth out because Mr S, who lived in woods and only ate raw foods, had bone inflammation and was allergic to fillings.

The dentist - known only as K - will also have to pay the cost of the patient's implants (stock image above)

The dentist even tried to demand 50,000 euros (£36,000) in compensation for damage done to his professional reputation by the trial.

An independent report found no basis for the operation.

The judge said K should have recognised that Mr S 'didn't quite tick right', adding that he was not a 'normal dentist'. K was also ordered to pay the cost of Mr S's implants.

Garry Monk will hold talks with Michu before making decision on Spaniard 's future . Michu has spent the season on loan at Italian outfit Napoli . The 29-year-old recently said he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea this summer .
-----------------------------------------------
Swansea manager Garry Monk says he will listen to Michu before deciding whether the Spaniard has a future at the Liberty Stadium.

The once-capped Spain striker has spent a frustrating season on loan at Napoli where injury has seen him make just five appearances for Rafa Bentitez's Serie A giants.

Michu scored 22 goals in his first season at Swansea after signing from Rayo Vallecano for £2.2million in July 2012 and broke into the Spain squad, but two injury-riddled campaigns since have raised doubts about his future in south Wales.

Garry Monk will hold talks with Michu, pictured in 2013, before making decision on Spaniard's future

Michu recently said he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea after his spell at Napoli

The 29-year-old told Spanish newspaper Marca last week he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea this summer to see out the final year of his contract - and Monk was also giving few clues when the subject was raised ahead of Everton's Barclays Premier League visit on Saturday.

'I'm sure we will make contact with Michu before the end of season,' Monk said.

'But we'll let his season finish and our season finish before we sit down at some point to discuss the future.

'I know he's had a difficult time with injury and his concentration right now is on getting back to fitness.

'He'll want to finish the season off strong there and I'll speak to him in the summer.

'I'll get his side of things and where he wants to take his future and I'll assess it from my side as well.'

Monk has been keeping a close eye on Michu during the Spaniard's loan spell at Italian outfit Napoli

Michu scored only twice in the Premier League last season before joining Napoli and Monk made it clear that the player was determined to head to Italy.

'I had a good discussion with him last summer and this was the way he wanted to go with Napoli,' Monk said.

'But he's coming back to full fitness now and hopefully he will have a good end to the season there.

'I've got a good relationship with Michu, we were team-mates before I became manager, and I was fine with how he wanted to go.

'I've kept an eye on him and it's our duty as a club to understand what's exactly going on with Michu on a game to game basis.

'He hasn't had a sustained period where he's been fit and it's always hard as a player when that happens.

'He's been unfortunate, but if he get can a sustained period of fitness I'm sure you'll see the quality we've seen here.'

Monk has heaped praise on Bafetimbi Gomis following the striker's recent fine goalscoring form

One player who has been fit and firing, however, is French striker Bafetimbi Gomis who has scored three goals in his last two appearances as Swansea have recorded back-to-back wins over Aston Villa and Hull to move within a single point of their best Premier League haul with seven games still remaining.

Gomis had a difficult first half to the season playing second fiddle to Wilfried Bony but the Ivorian's initial £25million sale to Manchester City has seen him become the club's first-choice striker and he has grasped the opportunity in recent weeks.

'When Wilfried left and he was starting games Bafe was probably too eager to do well,' Monk said.

'His effort and commitment have always been great but he was trying too hard to score goals.

'He's kept that effort and commitment but he's probably more relaxed now, he's showing his composure in games now and that is vitally important.'

Northampton will await expert opinion before deciding when George North will next play . Wales wing will miss Saturday 's European Champions Cup quarter-final at Clermont Auvergne . North has been knocked unconscious three times in recent months , including in last Friday 's 52-30 win over Wasps .
-----------------------------------------------
Northampton will await expert opinion before deciding when George North will next play after confirming the Wales wing will miss Saturday's European Champions Cup quarter-final at Clermont Auvergne after his latest head injury.

North has been knocked unconscious three times in recent months, including in last Friday's 52-30 win over Wasps, and was on Wednesday being assessed by a neurologist.

'We won't play him at the weekend,' Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder said.

George North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps

'Clearly he had a nasty knock. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. Thankfully he was well looked after, he came round very quickly and has had no real bad adverse after-effects. But even so, we won't play him this weekend.

'He's making good progress. He's improving and down there at the moment going to see a neurologist and we'll wait to see what the experts say.

'We've got to make sure the medical experts are happy and satisfied that he is fit to return to play and as soon as they say he is, then we'll be happy to pick him again.'

North left the field unconscious after scoring the second of two tries in Saints' win, with Wasps forward Nathan Hughes sent off for dangerous play as the Wales wing touched down.

Hughes protested his innocence but on Tuesday was banned for three weeks.

North also suffered blows to the head on Wales duty in the autumn and during the RBS 6 Nations when twice he had head knocks in the opener against England, controversially continuing before being stood down for the Scotland clash.

Former World Rugby medical adviser Dr Barry O'Driscoll says North - the top try-scorer in the competition with seven this season - should not play again this term.

Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head

Mallinder is not unduly concerned but will await medical opinion.

'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' Mallinder said.

'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion.

'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers, I suppose, of playing.

'We're always going to have incidents but player welfare will always come first. We will make sure we follow all protocols.'

North might have been eligible for Saturday's match, had he passed the return to play concussion protocols.

Mallinder added: 'If it was his first one (concussion) then we would be considering him, if he passed all the protocols that he had to and was available.

'Seeing as it's not his first then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion.'

Mallinder was reluctant to comment on Hughes' three-week ban - a punishment which left his Wasps team-mate James Haskell to tweet 'astounded would be an understatement' - but insisted he did not want to see the incident repeated.

The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher

Mallinder said: 'I said at the time I think it was a red card offence. I still do. The disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got.

'You've got to be very, very careful. George North scored a try and therefore there wasn't much anybody could do about that.

'You've got to make as much effort as you can to get away from that incident. We don't want that happening again.'

The English champions will, without North, bid to end Clermont's 22-game unbeaten run in European competition at Stade Marcel-Michelin.

Two previous meetings have been won by the Frenchmen, who have never lost a home quarter-final in the competition.

Mallinder said: 'It is going to be a massive challenge but we have had a few of these challenges over the years.

'I know when we have got a big game because you see in training when the intensity goes up.

'We have got a lot of players used to playing in big games. We are looking forward to it.'

North is congratulated after scoring the first of his two tries against Wasps on Friday night

Danielle Busby delivered all five girls via C-section . The parents are now a family of eight . The babies are named Ava Lane , Hazel Grace , Olivia Marie , Parker Kate and Riley Paige .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)It's been a busy few weeks for multiples.

The first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in Houston on April 8, and the parents are blogging about their unique experience.

Danielle Busby delivered all five girls at the Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section at 28 weeks and two days, according to CNN affiliate KPRC.

Parents Danielle and Adam and big sister Blayke are now a family of eight. The babies are named Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige.

"We are so thankful and blessed," said Danielle Busby, who had intrauterine insemination to get pregnant. "I honestly give all the credit to my God. I am so thankful for this wonderful hospital and team of people here. They truly all are amazing."

You can learn all about their journey at their blog, "It's a Buzz World."

Early news reports said the Busby girls were the first all-female quintuplets born in the U.S. But a user alerted CNN to news clippings that show quintuplet girls were born in 1959 to Charles and Cecilia Hannan in San Antonio. All of the girls died within 24 hours.

Like the Busby family, Sharon and Korey Rademacher were hoping for a second child. When they found out what they were having, they decided to keep it a secret from family and friends.

That's why they didn't tell their family the gender of baby No. 2 -- or that Sharon was actually expecting not one but two girls, according to CNN affiliate WEAR.

And when everyone arrived at West Florida Hospital in Pensacola, Florida, after Sharon gave birth March 11, they recorded everyone's reactions to meeting twins Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday and has been viewed more than 700,000 times.

Could you keep it a secret?

Luis Suarez's wife Sofia has revealed that the Barcelona star told her he didn't bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in Brazil - before admitting the truth 10 days later.

The Uruguayan received a four-month ban for the incident and was condemned by world football but still completed a £75million move from Liverpool to the La Liga side.

His wife admits that Suarez didn't believe that he had done anything but the television replays suggested otherwise and he then owned up.

Sofia told Canal 10: 'He told me he hadn’t done it. That is what he had in his head and even I began to believe it. But the television and radio spoke only about the bite and after 10 days of us being alone he told me the truth.

'On the day of the game I phoned him and asked what he had done. He responded with ‘what?’ The same had happened in England and I insisted: ‘Again?’ He replied: ‘I haven’t done anything. Are you not happy because Uruguay qualified?'

Ever since his ban was uplifted, Suarez has shone for his new side alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, with the La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey treble still very much a possibility.

The mother of Ms Scott's accused killed is traumatised by the event, according to Leeton Mayor Paul Maytom

'Obviously, she herself is traumatised by this whole incident too,' Cr Maytom told the publication after speaking to Ms Stanford.

The accused killer's mother asked the mayor to pass on her condolences to Ms Scott's devastated family and fiance Mr Leeson-Woodley.

School cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, has been charged with Ms Scott's murder and is due to appear in court in June.

'I think it was a good thing to let her know we are there for her and give her the opportunity to talk to someone. She expressed her condolences on behalf of her family to Stephanie's and to Aaron's families,' Cr Maytom told Fairfax. 

Mrs Stanford moved to the area just 14 months ago with two of her three adult sons. After Ms Scott's disappearance she went into hiding, not knowing how to deal with the situation.

The service to remember the life of the beloved teacher from Leeton will tragically be held at the venue intended for her wedding which was due to take place six days after she disappeared. 

It will take place in Eugowra in NSW's central west. 

On Tuesday the woman's heartbroken family shared a sweet photo of her as a little girl, giggling with her sisters in a bubble bath - as they invited all mourners to 'show their support of our beautiful Steph' for her funeral. 

Ms Scott's body was found by found by police in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, on April 10.

'Hi everyone. Tomorrow will be Stephanie's funeral… All are welcome to pay your respects,' wrote Stephanie Scott's sister Kim on Tuesday night.

'She was a beautiful girl and we'd all love to see you to show your support for her.'

Kim Scott asked everyone to 'show your support' for her sister, Stephanie Scott at her funeral on Wednesday

A memorial service will take place on Wednesday afternoon in Eugowra in NSW's central west.

Family, friends, students and even strangers will remember the brunette at ' Eat Your Greens' function centre - the location where Stephanie had planned to celebrate her wedding ten days before.

On Monday, Kim addressed a loving message to her late sister, posting the ode after preparing a photo slideshow for her funeral.

'I've laughed, I've cried, I've even tried to impersonate your heartfelt cackle, but after 95 slides, I still don't think I've done your beautiful life justice,' Kim wrote.

'You'll always be our little sister and always be our Button-Nose. We love you, Stephanie xxx,' she wrote.

Stephanie had been a respected and adore English and drama teacher at Leeton High School.

Leeton High School has made an touching gesture, sending a supportive message to the entire school community to acknowledge the grief they may feel as they face the daunting task of returning to school

Beloved teacher Stephanie Scott's workplace, Leeton High, commended the community for their strength

On Tuesday, the school used social media to reach out to staff, students and parents after their first day back after the school holidays.

It had also been the first day on campus without the beloved teacher.

'Once again, whenever strength, unity, leadership and integrity is asked of the whole student body, Leeton High's students rise to the challenge,' they wrote.

The school's facebook admin proceeded to commend the school community for their thoughtfulness after a beautiful, yellow-themed tribute was left for Ms Scott at the school following her disappearance.

'Just like at the fence tribute for Stephanie last Thursday, you guys were impeccable on this, the toughest of all school days.'

The high school where she worked became a memorial site after it emerged Ms Scott had been murdered

Their wedding was planned to take place at the Eat Your Greens function centre in the NSW town of Eugowra. Now, it will tragically be the venue for her funeral

120 guests were preparing to arrive at Stephanie's picturesque wedding venue on April 11. However, tragedy struck and her body was found on April 10

Kim Scott said her sister had designed the invitations and handmade pots for the reception table placements

'A Facebook post cannot convey our pride and respect right now.'

Classes will not be run as normal on Wednesday as the majority of teachers and many students will be attending Ms Scott's funeral.

Just days before, the school made an touching gesture, sending a supportive message to the entire school community to acknowledge the grief they may feel as they face the daunting task of returning to the campus.

'Tomorrow is the start of what will be the most difficult week of school life for both students and teachers,' the Leeton High School Facebook page wrote.

'We will be aided by a large number of people in supportive roles and there are several individuals and organisations to whom we offer so much gratitude.' 

The country high school called on the school to unite together, to be understanding and to take strength from the support they can offer each other.

'More importantly though, we have each other,' the post continues.

'Rest assured, if you stumble or fall, you will do so into the safe hands of many who care about you.'

'At other times, your hands could be needed and we know you will be there.'

'For Steph. For our school. For our town. For each other.'

The high school was the last known location of Ms Scott before the 26-year-old went missing on Easter Sunday - less than a week before her wedding to fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley. 

The drama and English teacher returned to the school alone that day to preparing lessons for the teachers who would replace her while she was on her honeymoon.

Instead tragedy struck and the 26-year-old's body was found by police in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, the following Friday afternoon.

On the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley a memorial was held. Her body was tragically found the day before

Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service on the day he had been due to marry the love of his life, Stephanie Scott

Stephanie Scott's sister Robyn commented on Leeton High School's Facebook post on Sunday evening, addressing a beautiful message to the students who meant so much to her sister.

'Just remember what my beautiful sister Stephanie loved. Teaching all you amazing students and seeing your smiling faces,' wrote Robyn.

'You are the ones who made her want to be the most amazing teacher, friend and person she could be.

'Be strong, Leeton. For Steph. And know she will be with you all in spirit as I know she is with her family and friends. Xxxxxxxxx.' 

The school has made counselling services available for students and held 'community support coffee mornings' to help bring staff, students and parents together during the school holidays.

'A community united grows stronger,' the school vowed. 

A vigil has been created at the school where the popular 26-year-old teacher taught drama and English

Cristiano Ronaldo and Co looked in a relaxed mood as Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti put his side through some small-sided games with some seemingly comical results.

Dani Carvajal was on the end of some tough love from team-mates Sergio Ramos, Isco and Nacho as the Madrid stars play-fought much to the amusement those watching on.

The European champions can expect a different kind of battle on Wednesday night as they look to make the most of home advantage against Atletico. 

The Madrid rivals players out a 0-0 draw in the first leg last week, leaving the quarter-final tie finely balanced. 

Ancelotti's side will be without striker Karim Benzema for Wednesday's match after revealing the French striker has has 'a sprain to the medial collateral ligament of his right knee.'

Benzema missed Madrid's 3-1 La Liga victory against Malaga on Saturday, but Carlo Ancelotti had hoped the striker would recover in time. 

Madrid was already preparing for the second leg of the quarterfinals at home against Atletico without Gareth Bale (left calf), Luka Modric (right knee) and Marcelo (suspension).

Atletico have beaten their neighbours four times and drawn against them three times in their bid for revenge for last season's Champions League final, which Real won 4-1 after extra time and Madrid forward James Rodriguez expects a tough match

'We have to show intensity, be completely focused, play well, (we must) all stick together. I think that if we do that we'll come away with an excellent result,' Rodriguez told the club's official website.

'We're all dreaming of getting through this round, and if I can score too that'd be great. What's important is winning and getting through this tough match, which is going to be difficult, but we're here at our home stadium and in front of our fans. I think it could be a great match.'

-----------------------------------------------
Australia's most notorious serial killer could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers, had the 'wrong man' not been sent to prison, a new investigation has claimed.

Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers.  

The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'.

Scroll down for video 

A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers  

Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report.

The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed.

'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands.

According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'.

Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims

'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris

Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. 

The first two bodies of Milat’s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest.

According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim

The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime

Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head.

The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl’s stabbed body in November of the same year.  

The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart.

First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later

Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death 

Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. 

He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago.

The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. 

The Milat Letters, is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992.

In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed.

Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder

Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW 

'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she’s 25, white. I ought to ask her “why” as she only knows me from a website, and there’s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 

'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.'  

Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail. 

An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al

In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope

One of his letters revealed plans to cut off his own finger and mail it law enforcement.

‘I will send them parts of my hand first, I have been considering this for a while and only need half a reason to show them how I feel with their sh**head ideas, there is not much they can do to me any more and at my age I don't give a f**k,' an excerpt from his letters reads. 

Milat tried to send his finger it in a padded envelope to the High Court.

The full story,The Ivan Milat Secret, will air on Channel 7 at 8:30pm on Sunday.

Arsenal legend Ian Wright has been confirmed as the man who will present AP McCoy with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at Sandown on Saturday.

Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports.

Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy’s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in.

Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move.

A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan.

A Sandown spokesman said; ‘Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony’s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.’

Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy’s sporting heroes from his childhood.

Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998

Family commitments will keep McCoy away from the Emirates on Sunday when his team host Chelsea in a top of the table clash.

Gov . Mary Fallin signs a bill allowing executions with nitrogen gas . Nitrogen gas causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen . CNN affiliate KFOR says it 's never been used in an execution in the United States .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable.

Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States.

"The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death," said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR.

Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same "painless" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections.

"The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically," he said.

Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett.

Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty.

"Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous," Fallin said. "I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."

The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.

A mother-of-two who lost her eye to skin cancer is warning people against the dangers of wearing cheap sunglasses.

Deborah Kane, from Tyldesley, Manchester, had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain.

The 46-year-old teaching assistant believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in Lanzarote when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper UV protection.

Deborah Kane, from  Manchester (pictured), had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop her skin cancer spreading to her brain

Debbie, pictured with her radiation mask, said, 'They drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye, so it was a horrible experience'

Debbie, who recently filmed a segment about her ordeal for an upcoming TV show called ‘Fake Britain’, says: 'I want to warn other women of the dangers of buying cheap sunglasses. The decision cost me my eye.

'But I know I’ve been lucky, because through losing my eye, my life was saved.'

To celebrate her recovery, Debbie held an aptly named ‘Eye Ball’ and named each table after a part of the eye.

She hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over £10,000 for The Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated.

Debbie’s problems first began when she was 24 and had a cancerous mole removed from her neck.

She was given the all-clear and put it behind her. Debbie went on to have two children, Annabel, now 14, and Charlie, eight.

'Having one eye doesn’t stop me at all and I’ve learned to be comfortable with the way I look,' says Debbie, pictured with her niece

But in December 2011, aged 42, she began to suffer with blurred vision. She was eventually diagnosed with a malignant melanoma behind her right eye.

Debbie says: 'My mind immediately went back to a teenage holiday in Lanzarote when I had been badly sunburned. I had blistered very badly on my neck, which was exactly the same place where I’d first had skin cancer.

'I had scrimped on sunglasses too; I bought cheap ones because they were trendy – but they didn’t protect my eyes at all.

'I used to buy lots of them every time I went on holiday because they only cost a couple of euros. I binned them all as soon as I was diagnosed with cancer.

She is now cancer free but has to stay out of the sun, and wears a patch over her eye, as she's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye. Pictured, Debbie with her doctors

'My consultant confirmed that the sun was definitely the cause and that the holiday was likely the starting point for cancer.

'I was so angry, so frustrated with myself. But it was too late for that.

'The lump was so big it was forcing the eye up and out of the socket.'

Her eye had to be removed, to stop the cancer spreading to her brain, but her consultant had never done that type of surgery before.

Debbie says: 'It was a huge risk and he discussed with experts from around the UK before my operation. In the end there were three consultants at my surgery.

'They drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye, so it was a horrible experience.'

In 2012, Debbie had nine hours of gruelling surgery followed by months of radiotherapy. But a year on, she made a good recovery and returned to work.

In 2013, she found a cancerous lump in her leg, which also had to be removed.

Her consultant believes that Debbie’s eye and leg tumours were both caused by rogue cells from the original tumour in her neck.

To celebrate her recovery, Debbie held an aptly named ‘Eye Ball’ (pictured) and named each table after a part of the eye

She hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over £10,000 for The Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated

She is now cancer-free but has to stay out of the sun, and wears a patch over her eye, as she's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye. 

Speaking about her Eye Ball, she says: 'My friend didn’t understand the concept and she told me she didn’t want to sit on "Len’s table" because she might not like him!' 

Debbie says: 'Having one eye doesn’t stop me at all and I’ve learned to be comfortable with the way I look. I work as a teacher, I drive a car and do everything like a normal mum.

'The way I see it, losing my eye saved my life. I just hope my story can save someone else.'

This video shows the horrifying moment a three-legged cat was mauled to death by two savage dogs in a brutal attack.

The disabled cat, called Freeman, was sitting in its front garden when the two dogs pounced, dragging the terrified cat on to its neighbour's lawn before tearing into the family pet.

Police are now investigating after a person, who appears to be a woman, pulls up in a blue car and collects the hounds - leaving the cat to die in agony.

The 90-second attack was captured on CCTV by a neighbour who passed the footage on to the cat's owner Tracy Lynch, from Tarring, West Sussex, and the police.

Ms Lynch, a 44-year-old mother-of-three, had owned the RSPCA rescue cat since 2004 and was devastated after watching the horrific video.

'To find out he had been savaged by the dogs and the owners had not done anything is just completely callous,' she said.

'That's what's most distressing for us that they didn't do anything to check on the cat.

'My youngest son was completely distraught. This is the first family pet he's lost and he was in floods of tears.'

A police spokesman said the large dogs, which were running loose, were possibly Dobermans and were collected by someone who turned up in a blue car.

The attack took place in Terry Rickards' front garden as he was away last week.

He said: 'It amazes and sickens me that no attempt was made either at the time the dogs were recovered, or at a later stage, to check on the state of the cat.

'As far as I am aware, no attempt has been made since by the dog owners to seek the owners of the cat. It's a pretty horrific attack really.'

Ms Lynch added: 'He would go around the neighbourhood and everyone knew him. He was a real character.

'I think the neighbours will miss him out and about.'

A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose from a tree , university officials say . The student is no longer on campus and will face student conduct review . The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday.

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review.

The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said.

Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved.

Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well.

Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media.

At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered.

"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' " Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd.

The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students.

Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled.

In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi.

A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus.

In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act."

"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect," Larry Moneta said Wednesday.

Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina.

CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.

Real Madrid travel to the Vicente Calderon for their quarter-final first-leg match on Tuesday, and Ancelotti admits facing Simeone is both an 'honour' and a 'problem'.

'He is a great coach, I like him a lot. He has proved himself, he is one of the best in the world. It’s an honour to face him and also a problem.

'We don’t have an obsession with Atletico, but with reaching the final of the Champions League. Our objective is not to beat Atletico, but to dream of winning the Champions League.

'Every match presents its own problem. Every match has its idea. Every defeat was different. One was due to set-pieces, one for something else, another due to a not very good attitude, like the last one. It’s difficult to say what happened.

The 55-year-old also revealed he has a fully fit squad to choose from on Tuesday evening with Welsh attacker Gareth Bale set to return to the first team after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday. 

'I am lucky to have the whole squad at my disposal. The formation will be the same as always. 

'To play well, we will have to use all our weapons: individual quality and attacking directly with pace.

'Bale is fine. I have the whole squad available and they are very fresh. If one doesn’t play, another will. But Bale is at 100 per cent.'

‘Bale had a fantastic season last time and scored in both finals. We hope to play more finals over the coming months and he will be important, like last year,' he added.

Meanwhile, Atletico’s Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic, who has scored five goals in eight Champions League appearances, has recovered from an ankle problem and is set to play, with Fernando Torres likely to be on the bench.

Maysak gained super typhoon status just a few days ago . It has since lost steam and is now classified as a tropical storm . It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph and gusts up to 90 mph . It 's expected to make landfall Sunday morning .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday.

Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean.

It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday.

Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop.

Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations.

Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora "will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like ... and will be advised to return to their respective places."

Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip.

It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday.

Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be "no ordinary typhoon."

Dry told PNA, "We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall."

Kevin Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in a last-ditch bid to earn his place in England 's Ashes squad this summer . Darren Gough says Pietersen only has a small chance of returning for England . Gough is taking part in the second Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for the Lord 's Taverners charity .
-----------------------------------------------
Darren Gough makes no secret that he'll always be the first man into bat for Kevin Pietersen no matter how sticky the wicket.

England's ninth most successful wicket taker of all-time is a loyal friend to the controversial batsman and was best man at his wedding.

Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in a last-ditch bid to earn his place in England's Ashes squad this summer - and all eyes will be on Cardiff for the start of his campaign against Glamorgan in just over a fortnight.

Darren Gough, Kevin Pietersen's close friend, says his pal only has a small chance of returning for England

Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer

But Gough believes there is still only a slim chance of his friend adding to his tally of 104 Test match appearances when England start their Ashes series on the same ground a few months later.

'I would say it's a pretty small percentage chance of seeing Kevin playing for England again,' said Gough, who is taking part in the second Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for the Lord's Taverners in July, the UK's leading youth cricket and disability sports charity, with the inaugural event raising over £280,000 for the Lord's Taverners and other charities in 2013

'It requires England's batsman to fail in the West Indies and then again against New Zealand, which is obviously something no England fan wants.

'The new ECB chairman has given Kevin a lifeline and he's got to make the runs now and put the pressure on.

Gough believes Pietersen will 'disappear to the Caribbean Premier League' if he doesn't get an England call

Gough says he has huge respect for Pietersen for pulling out of a big money deal in the India

'Good luck to him, if the others fail and he scores hundred after hundred, which I think he would have to do, the dream might just come true for him but realistically I would say the door is shut.

'If Kevin isn't selected for the first Test against Australia then he will probably disappear to the Caribbean Premier League and that will be that.

'I have huge respect for him for making that call and pulling out of a big money deal in the Indian Premier League to give it a shot, it shows just how much he wants it.

'If he got to the point where he's retiring and he didn't give it that last go, I don't think he would have been able to deal with that mentally.

'It's similar to me when I left Essex to go back to Yorkshire, I had unfinished business in Yorkshire and I went back for a couple of years.

'I can live happily ever after on that because I went back and fulfilled what I wanted to achieve and it's the same for KP.'

Controversial batsman Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship

England face Australia in just under 100 days time - a team with soaring confidence after their World Cup win

Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship but even proud Yorkeshireman Gough believes the former Lancashire coach must be give a bit more time - despite last month's World Cup horror show.

Moores admits he's a man under pressure ahead of the three Test series in the Caribbean, which starts in Antigua in just under two weeks.

And it doesn't get any easier with two Test and five one-day internationals against in-form New Zealand followed by the arrival of Darren Lehman's Australia in just under 100 days time - a team whose confidence is soaring.

'We've got a good coach with England and he knows what he is doing but his personality is more about percentages,' added Gough. 'He gets a lot of stick about stats but every team uses stats.'

Gough plans to competes in the Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for Lord's Taverners charity

While England toil this summer Gough has other plans as he competes in the Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge which will raises funds for the Lord's Taverners charity.

Gough, the first to admit he's not got the physique for lycra, will lead a cricketing peleton as they cycle between England's Test match grounds over four days this summer, with the challenge taking place between 12 and 15 July 2015 and will cover over 300 miles between the famous 2005 Ashes venues, with the Kia Oval the finish line in four months' time.

'I'm okay on a motorbike but a bike is going to be a big challenge,' he said.

'We are hoping to raise enough funds to buy five minibuses that can be used to help disadvantaged and disabled children get into sport.

'I've always liked a challenge and when it's raising money for a wonderful cause you want to get involved.'

Medical incident officer joined team caring for patients at Worcestershire Royal Hospital last Friday . It came as the West Midlands Ambulance Service demanded action following delays in treatment . Worcester 's Acute Hospitals NHS Trust admitted circumstances were ` less than ideal ' and said it was ` working very hard '
-----------------------------------------------
A doctor usually deployed to major disaster zones was sent in to a hospital's under-pressure A&E department as staff were forced to treat patients in the corridor, it has emerged.

The medical incident officer joined the team caring for patients at Worcestershire Royal Hospital last Friday.

It came as the West Midlands Ambulance Service demanded action following delays in treatment.

The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust admitted circumstances were 'less than ideal'.

A medical incident doctor, usually deployed to major disaster zones, was sent to help staff at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital's under-pressure A&E department, it has emerged

It came as the weekly national figures from NHS England showed it has missed the four-hour waiting time target for the 28th consecutive week, despite a slight improvement.

The proportion of patients seen within the Government maximum of four hours at A&E departments in England is below the target of 95 per cent again - they have not been met since September 28.

NHS England said 92.5 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge in the week ending April 12. This was a slight improvement on the previous week, when it was 92.4 per cent.

The figures include data from last Friday, April 10, where the MIO was sent in to help at Worcestershire Royal Hospital after months of problems. 

A Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust spokesman apologised for last Friday's incident, and said it was 'working very hard' to prevent it from happening again.

An A&E consultant at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital was one of five senior doctors who resigned from their jobs amid the crisis affecting emergency departments at two hospitals.

In February four consultants from the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch quit their roles, on the same day as their colleague at the Worcestershire Royal.

It left Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust with the task of filling five vacancies in a matter of months as the doctors work their notice periods.

In a damning open letter to the trust, four of the consultants branded the NHS trust a 'disgrace' and claimed they had been put under 'unbearable stress'.

The 1,700 word letter, signed by Richard Morrell, Sarah Crawford, Christopher Hetherington and David Gemmell, said: 'The trust appears to tolerate massive overcrowding in the county's A&E departments.

'This is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all A&E staff.

'The situation has taken a heavy toll on our personal and family lives - the stress has been unbearable at times.

'We are battle-weary and exhausted by the continuous pressure that we have been under.'

The trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm that on Friday April 10, West Midlands Ambulance paramedics were asked to look after a number of patients in the corridor before they could be transferred in to the care of the A&E staff.

'While the A&E department were unable to allow the ambulance staff to hand over the patients, the A&E staff were aware of their conditions and we wish to assure people that no patients came to any harm.'

The spokesman said the medical incident officer was brought in after concerns were raised by the West Midlands Ambulance Service.

The spokesman added: 'Both the hospital and ambulance service are working under extreme pressures at the moment, due to a number of external factors. 

'Regretfully these pressures have meant some patients being treated in less than ideal conditions and we accept this is not good enough and are working very hard to put this right.

'We are sorry for any distress caused to patients and their families. 

'We now need to work together with the ambulance service and other partners to sort the situation out as soon as possible.'

Ray Salmon, regional organiser for Unison, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the incident was not 'a new problem' and had 'been building up over a period of months'.

He described the situation as 'completely unprecedented', and that the union members were 'furious'.

He said: 'One of our reps went public just after Christmas and blew the whistle about the problems and the trust tried to exclude him from the premises, we had a massive argument about that and I reckon that since then the problem is getting even worse.

'Then last week when the ambulance service had to bring in their own doctor, well that was actually just completely unprecedented, it's really winding people up.'

The trust said no patients came to any harm during last Friday's incident, but Mr Salmon said the situation was starting to affect patient care.

The move came as staff were forced to treat patients in the hospital's corridors. (File image posed by model)

He said: 'It's a combination of bad planning and it's also a combination of under-resourcing.

'We've been saying for years the Government hasn't put enough money in to the NHS.

'You listen to the politicians at the moment and the gloating about what a great job they've done over the last five years, and they're talking about what they're going to do over the next five years.

'But the situation is at the moment there's just not enough resources gone in, there's not enough staff, and that's affecting patients, it's totally unacceptable.' 

According to today's NHS waiting times figures, there were 443,274 attendances in A&E for the seven-day period, up slightly on the previous week when it was 441,099.

The number of people waiting for more than four hours was 7,434 - slightly lower than 7,459 a week earlier.

Similarly, the number of people waiting for more than 12 hours was 15 - down from 22 the previous week.

Emergency admissions were 102,163, compared with 106,160 the previous week.

-----------------------------------------------
Hillary Clinton's most trusted – and most controversial – campaign aide turned up on Wednesday near Des Moines, Iowa, where the former secretary of state sat for her second staged 'roundtable' discussion in as many days.

Abedin had last surfaced on Monday at an Ohio Chipotle restaurant when she and Clinton popped in, both wearing sunglasses, for lunch.

On Tuesday she was photographed leaving a Norwalk, Iowa fruit processing company and walking toward 'Scooby,' the now-famous customized black van that Secret Service agents have driven more than 1,000 miles since Sunday. 

HUMA, SANS BURRITO: Abedin left Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa on Wednesday ahead of Hillary Clinton, and headed toward the campaign van that aides have nicknamed 'Scooby'

ALL DONE! Clinton had just finished a limited-access 'roundtable' discussion on small business issues

Abedin has known Clinton since 1996, when she scored a White House internship working for the then-first lady.

In 2008 Clinton tapped her to be her 'body woman' when she ran for president the first time. She shadowed Hillary everywhere and anticipated her every need – from food orders and dry cleaning to lint rollers and cosmetic touch-ups.

When Clinton became secretary of state a year later, Abedin became her deputy chief of staff.

It was there that she became linked to most recent in a series of scandals that Clinton will carry as heavy baggage whiel she runs for the White House.

Daily Mail Online confirmed in March that Abedin had a personal email address on Clinton's home-brew server, the same piece of hardware that stored Clinton's communications from her tenure at State until she deleted more than 32,000 of the records.

Spotted: Hillary and Huma order at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio, at lunchtime on Tuesday – the first time they had been seen all day. But nobody in the restaurant recognized them during their 45-minute meal

Abedin keeps a low profile, a choice that a Democratic Party insider said is the product of two problems.

'First, you never want to be more famous than your boss,' the source explained on Wednesday.

'And then there's the Weiner problem.'

Abedin is married to disgraced former New York Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose spectacular fall from grace came after he was exposed for sending lurid Twitter messages to women – including one of his barely covered genitalia.

She stood by him through the embarrassment and through his resignation from Congress. 

Weiner ran for Mayor of New York City last year, only to see his stock tumble with a second round of sexting allegations, this time confirmed by the woman he was exchanging racy messages with.

'Scooby' is a customized and armored Chevy van that Clinton and her top staffers occupied during a 1,000-mile trip from New York to Iowa this week

EMAIL-GATE: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis

Abedin and Weiner have a 2-year-old child together.

After she returned from maternity leave in June 2012, the State Department made a special accommodation for her that is now the subject of an inspector general accommodation.

Abedin was permitted to shift her employment classification from 'employee' to 'Special Government Employee,' a perk that allowed her to have a second income while drawing a government salary.

That moonlight gig was at Teneo Holdings, a corporate consulting firm founded by Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton confidant. 

The State Department paid Abedin $135,000 per year to work part-time from her New York City home. Teneo paid her an additional $355,000 via an annual contract.

The whopping combined income helped her household stay financially afloat in the wake of Weiner's resignation, and his loss of a congressional salary.

A few months ago Aston Villa would have been happy with Premier League survival. Now they have a chance for so much more.

In recent years Villa have struggled to compete but they are a proper club. When I left Arsenal for Villa it was because I felt they shared similar traits - tradition, history and both took pride of place in their communities.

Villa were one of the founder members of the Football League and in the early years of the FA Cup, the trophy was almost theirs to keep. Now this group has a chance to embrace that history and write the next chapter.

Martin Keown joined Aston Villa in 1986 and made the move because of the club's rich history and tradition

Tim Sherwood has invigorated this side and you can feel that improvement in their performances. But for all the excitement Villa fans must be patient.

Talking about getting a club ‘back where they belong’ can be a dangerous game. Villa won the European Cup in 1982 and while there’s nothing wrong with being ambitious, fans have to be realistic.

Previous generations at Villa have seen success and can be too demanding. Even when they were challenging for the Champions League under Martin O’Neill there were still rumblings of discontent.

When things do start to go wrong, Villa Park can be an unforgiving place. I experienced that when I was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play. But what ground isn’t when things are going badly?

In the past Villa Park has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at Wembley was magnificent. Now with Sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with his side.

Making the final is a fine achievement and Sherwood and his players will be desperate to become part of the fabric of a fantastic club.

Peter Gale , 47 , dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey . Sacked for ` unprofessional and inappropriate conduct ' two weeks ago . Investigation reveals he sent ` informal ' emails to sixth form pupil . School rules forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private accounts .
-----------------------------------------------
Sacked: Peter Gale was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey two weeks ago

The male headmaster of a leading all-girls’ grammar school has been sacked after sending a series of private emails to a teenage pupil, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Peter Gale, 47, was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey for ‘unprofessional and inappropriate conduct’ two weeks ago.

At the time of the announcement, the school’s governors failed to release any more details.

However, an investigation by this newspaper has discovered that Mr Gale – who became the academy’s first male head when he was appointed to the post 18 months ago – sent informal emails over a period of months to the sixth-form pupil, including messages written at night and during the holidays.

School rules strictly forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private email accounts.

The Cheam academy has described Mr Gale’s actions a ‘serious breach of safeguarding procedures’. Despite this, the National Union of Teachers appeared to play down the seriousness of his conduct.

In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, the union implied Mr Gale’s actions only amounted to a breach of the school’s information and communications technology rules. The governors – who began their investigation following a tip-off – are said to have been ‘stunned’ by the NUT statement.

The specialist science college and languages school, which counts singer Katie Melua and Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell among its alumni, passed judgment on Mr Gale at an internal disciplinary hearing earlier this month, ruling he had broken rules in place to prevent personal communications between staff and pupils.

It is understood this was in breach of guidance telling teachers never to use a private email account to send messages to pupils, partly for their own protection.

The school has refused to reveal the precise content of the emails, but it is understood they were informal and read like text messages.

It is believed there were also concerns about the way Mr Gale, the former deputy headmaster of all-girl Rosebery School in nearby Epsom, had treated the student differently from other pupils.

Mr Gale, who is understood to be unmarried and who lives in Godalming, Surrey, declined to comment directly to The Mail on Sunday.

Messages: An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has revealed it was a series of 'informal' emails to a sixth form pupil which led to his dismissal from the specialist science college  (pictured)

Alumni: Former pupils include Kate Melua (pictured) and Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell

But a statement sent to this newspaper, released by the NUT’s London Regional Secretary Bob Stapley, said: ‘The alleged misconduct related to communication with a student which breached the school’s policy on the accepted use of ICT [information and communications technology].

‘Mr Gale accepted he had breached the school’s policy and that as headmaster he had responsibility for ensuring he and other staff acted in accordance with the policy.

Defence: The NUT have said: 'Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made'. Pictured: The school's motto

‘Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made. Mr Gale appreciates that this placed governors in a difficult situation given that rumours could have a negative effect upon the reputation of the school.’

The statement added he was considering whether to appeal against ‘the severity of the sanction imposed by the Disciplinary Panel’.

Chairman of governors, Tony Hyams-Parish, said in a letter to parents this month: ‘The governing body has terminated Peter Gale’s employment at Nonsuch High School for Girls due to serious breaches in applying safeguarding procedures and instances of unprofessional and inappropriate conduct.

‘This was not an easy decision, especially because we recognise that since Peter’s appointment there have been many positive changes within the school led by Peter and the senior leadership team.

‘However, the governing body and staff take their safeguarding responsibilities towards students very seriously and, importantly, any breaches of safeguarding procedures, and have therefore acted promptly to address these matters.’

Carol Dickie, the school’s bursar, said the education of the 1,200 pupils would be unaffected by the sacking, despite it coming just weeks before GCSE and A-level exams.

-----------------------------------------------
Jerusalem (CNN)The Israeli military conducted airstrikes Sunday night in the area between Israel and Syria, targeting a group of militants allegedly trying to plant a bomb on the Israeli border.

The Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes were carried out in the occupied Golan Heights against four militants who crossed into the area from Syria.

"A group of armed terrorists approached the border with an explosive device, which was intended to be detonated against IDF forces," the Israeli military said.

The airstrikes prevented the bombing, the military said.

Three of the alleged attackers were killed, Israeli media reported, citing IDF sources.

It was not immediately known to what militant group the men belonged.

The Golan is regarded internationally as occupied territory despite Israeli governmental control. It is home to 41,000 residents, including Jews, Druze and Alawites. Israel seized the territory from Syria during the 1967 Israel-Arab war, and it was eventually annexed.

Press conference: Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, left, and ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummins, D-Md., speak with reporters on Wednesday 

Pilot: The man who piloted the gyrocopter and landed on the West Lawn, 61-year-old Doug Hughes, is 'lucky to be alive' and 'should have been blown out of the air,' Chaffetz said 

Campaign: Hughes' stunt was aimed at drawing attention to campaign finance reform

Chaffetz said security tracked Hughes as he approached the Capitol last week after taking off from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A 'judgment call' was made not to shoot Hughes down, Chaffetz said. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down Hughes.

Chaffetz said a combination of 'lack of communication and some human error' by Capitol Police and other officials allowed Hughes to steer his tiny aircraft within a few hundred feet of the Capitol before landing on the West Lawn.

Chaffetz said he was deeply concerned at 'a lack of coordination and communication' among law enforcement agencies charged with what he called 'a no-fail mission' to protect the Capitol and other important sites in Washington, including the White House.

Cummings called the incident a 'wake-up call' to all law enforcement agencies involved. Capitol Police, the Secret Service and other agencies need 'to look very carefully at what happened here, dissect it, figure it out and use this to make things better,' Cummings said.

Cummings and Chaffetz said they were outraged that members of Congress were not alerted to the potential security threat even as parts of the Capitol complex were placed under lockdown.

'That's inexcusable,' Chaffetz said.

Chaffetz and Cummings said they will hold a hearing on the incident next week with representatives of six agencies: the Secret Service, Capitol Police, Congress' Sergeant at Arms, the Federal Aviation Administration, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the U.S. Park Police.

Three of the agencies - the FAA, NORAD and the park police - were no-shows at Wednesday's briefing, irking lawmakers.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down Hughes

Security: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week that Hughes 'literally flew under the radar' to the Capitol lawn, but added that it's too soon to say whether security changes are needed

Issues: Hughes was charged with two federal crimes, violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft. The crimes carry penalties of up to four years in prison and fines

'They've got a lot of explaining to do' about why they did not attend the briefing, Chaffetz said.

Lawmakers were told during the briefing that 'incursions' into the restricted air space around Washington occur nearly every day and are usually 'dealt with in a smooth and professional manner,' Chaffetz said, in stark contrast to the gyrocopter incident.

Lawmakers raised alarms about security after Hughes' stunt, which was aimed at drawing attention to campaign finance reform.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week that Hughes 'literally flew under the radar' to the Capitol lawn, but added that it's too soon to say whether security changes are needed.

'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society, and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson said.

Chaffetz said there is a 'heightened awareness' about the risks of small aircraft in the wake of the gyrocopter stunt.

Anyone who enters restricted airspace now will have 'a major problem,' Cummings said.

Hughes was charged with two federal crimes, violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft. The crimes carry penalties of up to four years in prison and fines.

Hughes' next court appearance is May 8.

A New York City bus driver is facing possible termination after video emerged of him looking at papers and driving with his wrists and forearms.

A woman who boarded the driver's bus in Ozone Park, Queens, recorded the unidentified driver marking a set of papers with a highlighter and  looking away from the road.

She was 'shocked' that the driver's behavior continued the entire ten minutes she was on the bus, in which all the seats were full. 

A New York City bus driver running a route in Queens is facing possible termination after an unidentified commuter recorded him driving with papers in his hand

The driver was seen with both hands on a piece of paper, believed to be a timetable for his route replacing the closed section of a subway, and driving the bus with his wrists and forearms

The commuter who captured the distracted driving on a bus with only standing room said that the behavior occurred the entire time she was travelling 

'He jeopardized the lives of everyone on that bus and anyone on the street,' the commuter said. 

The papers in his hand were likely timetables used to make sure he was stopping at all the correct junctures on Saturday evening,  the New York Post reported, citing a transit source.

The bus was being used to replace part of a subway line closed for maintenance during the weekend.

New York's Metro Transportation Authority, which runs the city's buses, said that 'bus operators are expected to have their full attention on safe operations at all times'.

The driver has been taken out of passenger service while the agency investigates, and could face possible penalties including termination or retraining depending on his work history, according to a New York Post source.

New York City adopted new laws last year as part of an effort to eliminate traffic accidents, such as the February 2014 crash between an city bus and a truck that careened into a building on 7th Avenue

This weekend's video comes as New York City has targeted speeding and reckless motorists in a bid to eliminate traffic deaths

A  law pushed into law by Mayor Bill DeBlasio last August has increased penalties on drivers, including MTA employees, who hit pedestrians after failing to yield.

Bus drivers have said they are under attack by the new regulations, and that accidents happen even when drivers are doing their jobs properly. 

At least nine pedestrians were killed by transportation authority buses last year, according to the New York Times.

Fred Pagan , 49 , was paid $ 160,000 in his Senate role last year . He is accused of buying the drugs to exchange for sexual favors . Pagan has worked for Sen . Thad Cochran since he was 16 years old .
-----------------------------------------------
A Mississippi Senator's personal assistant has been charged with trafficking drugs from China to use as payment for sexual favors.

Police launched an investigation after seizing a package on April 9 with over a kilo of the date rape drug GBL addressed to  Fred Pagan, office manager and personal assistant to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS).

Raiding his home on Thursday, they uncovered 181.5 grams of meth.

Senator: Thad Cochran (R-MS) has yet to comment on the fact that his personal assistant and office manager Fred Pagan has been charged with trafficking drugs, including methamphetamine, from China 

Pagan was paid $160,000 in his Senate role last year, the Washington Post reports. 

The paper states Pagan, 49, has worked for Cochran since he was 16 years old. 

He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance.

The former is punishable by five to 40 years in prison, the latter by up to 20.

Pagan was released on Friday after an initial court appearance. He will appear again on May 14. 

Court documents read by The Washington City Paper say Pagan admits he acquired three loads of drugs through a dealer.

He is accused of buying the substances to exchange for sexual favors. 

Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details.

He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.'

GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB.

It is illegal to manufacture or sell either variant of the drug in the United States.

Users can face two years in prison, suppliers up to 14 years.

The drug, which is in liquid form, is packaged is select types of plastic as it is said to burn through many normal types of packaging.

She believes it may belong to the property 's previous tenant . Ms Woods called the RSPCA but they were unable to help . So she posted an appeal on Facebook and a local woman recognised the snake .
-----------------------------------------------
A mother was left in shock after her four-year-old daughter discovered a four-foot snake in the bath - just a week after moving into the house.

Michelle Woods, from Norton in Teesside, was told by her daughter Elisha Mann that 'something was moving' in the bath.

And when the pair walked into the bathroom to check what was there, that's when they came face to face with the reptile.

The four-foot red and orange corn snake, which Michelle Woods discovered slithering around in the bathroom of her new home. She believes it may belong to the property's previous tenant 

Mrs Woods, a full-time mother, said: 'I thought she was joking, but Elisha made me go and have a look, so I went and checked the bin and nothing was there.

'But then I looked up and I was face-to-face with a snake. I nearly jumped out of my skin and slammed the door shut.

'I even made sure our cat Smotker was locked downstairs in case it tried to attack it. I had no idea at the time if it was dangerous or not.'

Panicking, Ms Woods said she called the RSPCA, who were unable to help - so in desperation, posted an appeal on Facebook.

Within an hour, a local woman who keeps snakes had recognised her plight and identified the reptile as a corn snake, a non-venomous species normally kept as a pet.

The woman then came to the house and took away the snake so Ms Woods and Elisha could get a good night's sleep.

Ms Woods, 44, added: 'It was a great response. Obviously, they thought I was just joking at first but when I sent them a picture they posted it up online and I got some help straight away.

Michelle Woods with her daughter Elisha Mann, who first spotted the snake in the bath before alerting her mother 

It is not clear how the snake ended up in the bathroom, but Ms Woods believes that the previous tenant may have kept snakes as pets and lost the red and orange reptile while moving.

She explained: 'We couldn't think of another way it could have got into the house, but goodness knows where it had been for the week we lived there before he spotted it.

'I was petrified at first and I was a bit nervoud about using the bathroom for the rest of the night.

'But luckily we haven't found anything else yet!'

But the encounter didn't faze four-year-old Elisha, who said: 'When I saw the snake it was really still.

'I wasn't scared at all. I knew not to touch it. I'm looking forward to telling me friends about it at school.'

Bath face Newcastle in the Aviva Premiership on Friday night . Sam Burgess has been selected in the back row by Mike Ford . Bath were knocked out of the European Champions Cup by Leinster . Click here for all the latest Bath news . CLICK HERE for the latest rugby union news .
-----------------------------------------------
Sam Burgess has been selected in the back row as Bath seek to bounce back from the end of their European dream by defeating Newcastle on Friday night.

Burgess has spent the vast majority of his fledgling union career at inside or outside centre, but head coach Mike Ford will examine his credentials at blindside flanker in the Aviva Premiership showdown at Kingston Park.

The former rugby league star has struggled to make an impact in the midfield since converting to union towards the end of last year and Ford has repeatedly stated that he views the back row as the most suitable home for his explosive ball-carrying and defence.

Sam Burgess has featured mainly at centre for Bath since his arrival from the South Sydney Rabbitohs 

Burgess leaves the pitch following his side's European Champions Cup defeat by Leinster on Saturday 

Burgess was called into England's RBS 6 Nations squad to step-up his education in the new code, although he was never considered for selection by the Red Rose who regard him as an inside centre.

The 26-year-old's slow progress since departing the South Sydney Rabbitohs has led to speculation he may return to league, but Jason Robinson is among those who believe he can still win a place in England's World Cup squad.

Burgess' elevation to the starting XV is one of eight changes made to the team dumped out of the Champions Cup by an 18-15 quarter-final defeat to Leinster in Dublin.

Burgess was called into Stuart Lancaster's England squad during the RBS 6 Nations 

South Africa flanker Francois Louw leads the side as regular skipper Stuart Hooper has a calf injury, while Semesa Rokoduguni is restored to the right wing.

Victory over Newcastle at Kingston Park would strengthen Bath's claim to home advantage in the Premiership play-offs and lift them up to second place, albeit temporarily if Saracens defeat Leicester.

Newcastle have replaced Tom Catterick with Rory Clegg as one of four changes as they seek to make inroads into the seven-point gap separating them from London Irish in 10th place.

Two scantily-clad strippers performed at a Taiwanese man 's funeral . The exotic dancers were hired by the deceased 's own wife . They danced around the casket to Maroon 5 's Moves Like Jagger . Mourners were more interested in filming the dancers than remembering their friend .
-----------------------------------------------
Between the tears, eulogies and final farewells, funerals are typically a sombre affair.

So mourners at a Taiwanese man's memorial were shocked after they were treated to a sexy performance by two scantily-clad strippers - hired by the deceased's own wife, The People's Daily Online reported.  

Dressed in little more than  underwear and thigh-high boots, the exotic dancers showed off their moves in a scene more fitting to a strip club than a funeral home.

Scroll down for video 

Two hot dancers wearing just bras and miniskirts danced around the casket showing off their sexy moves to open mouthed mourners

Bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase Drop Dead Gorgeous the women gyrated around the coffin to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger in front of the open-mouthed mourners.

At one stage they even draped themselves over the casket as part of their routine.

Incredibly it was the deceased's wife who booked the dancers as a final gift to her husband.

Mrs Jian said she knew her spouse always had an eye for the ladies and wanted to ensure that his final journey was one that he would appreciate.

The exotic dancers had been hired by Mrs Jian, from Taiwan, who said she booked them to perform at her husband’s funeral as her last gift to him

Taichung Funeral Home in Taipei, Taiwan was turned into a makeshift gentleman's club when the dance music began pumping and neon lights started flashing as the girls went through their moves on the morning of April 12.

Some mourners appeared to be more interested in filming the sexy dancers rather than remembering their departed friend as they vied for the best position to take photos and videos on their smart phones. 

Family and friends of the deceased expressed their shock during the performance but it didn't stop the dancers who went through three different fast paced songs.

They then disappeared before the drums played and the coffin was taken to the awaiting car and the start of the solemn funeral ceremony. 

Friends said the extremely understanding Mrs Jian was a devoted wife and after Mr Jian had suffered a stroke before his death, she would spend every minute at his bedside, attending to his every need. 

Draped across the coffin, the women are happy to pose for pictures in between dancing to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger

Mourners appeared to be more concerned about filming the sexy dancers rather than remembering their departed friend Mr Jian

The Taiwanese phenomenon of having exotic dancers or strippers perform at funerals began in the 1980s and is thought to be connected to the local mafia who were said to have seized control of the mortuary industry and offered strippers from their clubs at a cut price.

For a modest fee the scantily-clad women arrive on the neon-lit back of a diesel truck, dubbed an Electric Flower Car, to gyrate erotically in front of the departed and his mourners.

The cars also offer an easy getaway if police arrive to the scene.

Some have labelled the practice as scandalous, but others claim it as an important part of the grieving process - and the perfect way of sending off their loved ones with a smile.

In Taiwanese culture, the more people who attend the funeral then the more honour was given to the deceased.

So the strippers were used to 'bribe' more mourners into turning up.

Other theories suggest the entertainment was because the ghosts of the deceased enjoyed watching strippers while they were alive.

The funerals also provide one of the few forms of live entertainment for many of the rural poor communities in Taiwan.

The Neil finished 13 over par after competing in his first Masters . The 19-year-old has been tipped for big things by the likes of Rory McIlroy . Neil won the Scottish Boys Championship in 2013 and the British Amateur Championship last year .
-----------------------------------------------
It was not the role Bradley Neil would have wanted — the job of being the boy reminding Augusta just how brilliant Jordan Spieth’s opening had been.

For while the 21-year-old American was chewing up golf’s most spectacular course, the teenager from Scotland was suffering the role in reverse.

Neil earned his invitation to the Masters after winning the Scottish Boys Championship in 2013 and then the British Amateur Championship last year.

Bradley Neil finished 13 over par after competing in his first Masters 

Still an amateur, the 19-year-old is being tipped for huge things when he does turn pro by no less a star than world No 1 Rory McIlroy.

And he had the calming influence of veteran fellow Scot Sandy Lyle playing alongside him as he stepped on to the first tee hoping to recover from a six-over-par round on day one.

There was promise as he atoned for hoisting his drive into the trees alongside the fairway with a recovery shot that put him 30 feet from the hole.

But three putts later on the first of Augusta’s lightning fast greens, memorably described by Peter Alliss as ‘like trying to roll a ball down the bonnet of a car and stopping it before it falls off’, reality was beginning to bite.

The young Scot has been tipped for big things by the likes of Rory McIlroy

He did birdie the par-five second, but then came five more dropped shots to reach the turn in 41, and the youngster finished the day on 79, 13 over par in all and facing the truth that his big weekend was already over.

‘I’d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,’ he admitted.

‘I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here.

‘I’m jealous that Sandy gets to come back here every year, and I also want to do that in the future.’

Lyle, who won the green jacket in 1988 as one of the two major wins of his career, is 57 and a student of traditional hickory clubs — he won the World Hickory Open at Carnoustie last year.

He even used a putter from the bygone era as he made his 34th Masters appearance. But although he three-putted only once, he carded a 76 to end day two at six over par.

Fidel Castro was last seen in public in January 2014 at the inauguration of an artist 's studio in Havana . State-run Cubadebate published photos of him meeting Venezuelans in Havana on Friday , though the encounters were said to have taken place on Monday . He is shown shaking hands , which Cubandebate said occurred ` for hours , ' with Venezuelans who had come for solidarity events .
-----------------------------------------------
Former Cuban president Fidel Castro has appeared in public for the first time in more than a year, his first since his country reached a landmark agreement with the US to reestablish ties.

The state-run Cubadebate website says Castro greeted a group of Venezuelans visiting the capital of Havana.

Cubadebate on Friday published four images that show Castro sitting inside a bus, each with a different person stretching an arm through the window to shake his hand.

Images of Fidel Castro meeting with Venezuelan visitors to Havana were reported in Cuban media on Friday, though the encounters were said to take place on Monday

The meetings, with photos taken inside Castro's bus, are the former president's first public appearance since January 2014

Castro's face is largely obscured by a dark-colored baseball cap. He sports longish gray hair and a beard.

The website said the encounter occurred Monday, but did not explain the delay in publishing the photos.

He is shown shaking hands, which Cubandebate said occurred 'for hours,' with Venezuelans in Havana who had come for solidarity events.

Castro will turn 89 on Aug. 13. He was last seen in public at the inauguration of an artist's studio in January 2014. 

In February and March of this year, official Cuban media published photographs of Castro taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader and with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

State media reports about the event said that Castro was 'full of vitality' and shook hands 'for hours' before going to a school

Castro, whose country has close ties with the leftist Venezuelan government, said that the South American country had become the target of 'imperial greed'

Though Monday's reported appearance is his first in public since a landmark deal to reestablish ties between the US and Cuba, Castro met with spies released by the US in the agreement earlier this year 

He also appeared with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December after a landmark agreement between the Obama administration and his brother Raul to reestablish ties between the island and the US.

Fidel, older than his brother by five years, expressed skepticism about the deal, which includes plans for a US Embassy in Havana and has lessened travel restrictions. 

Cuban media said that Castro's meeting went off 'without the slightest of problems' and he urged his residents to write to Obama and urge him to stop saying that Venezuela y was a threat.

It said that the former leader talked about how the South American country had become a target for 'imperial greed'. 

The American president signed sanctions against several Venezuelan officials earlier this year.

Castro, whose recent public appearances often largely serve the function of proving that he is alive, was said to be 'full of vitality'. 

He also reportedly stopped and spoke at a school. 

The former revolutionary stepped aside temporarily as president due to serious illness in July 2006, and Raul took over permanently in February 2008 after he was elected the country's new leader.

Campaign chiefs attempted to rebuff letter from 100 business leaders . Called for a Labour government signed by people ` from all walks of life ' But plan was in chaos as it was found the signatories included a benefit fraudster , trade unionists and the cigar-smoking children of millionaires .
-----------------------------------------------
Labour were left embarrassed tonight after it was forced to remove a signatory to a letter of support after she was exposed as a benefit cheat who had swindled nearly £30,000.

Campaign chiefs attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’.

The signatories, who said they were ‘all working people’, warned about the ‘proliferation of zero-hours contracts’ they claimed were ‘letting down Britain’ and showed that ‘we need a Labour Government to put working people first’.

Labour attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’

But within hours the plan was in chaos as it was found the signatories included a benefit fraudster, trade unionists and the cigar-smoking children of millionaires. 

One of the signatories identified herself as someone who had ‘worked on [a] zero hours contract’, but Labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012.

A court in Manchester heard that the woman moved to Britain after she had a ‘marriage of convenience’ in Nigeria in December 2007.

According to tax officials she lived with her ‘husband’, who was the holder of a British passport, ‘briefly or not at all’.

She was not entitled to benefits as she was subject to ‘immigration control’, but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children, two of whom didn’t live with her.

The court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed £27,888 tax credits in two and a half years as a single person.

David Cameron, visiting pupils during his visit to King's Leadership Academy in Warrington today, hailed the business letter in support of the Tories

She was caught after she applied for leave to remain in Britain on the basis of her ‘marriage’. Officers found that she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the UK.

In July 2012 she was given a two year suspended jail sentence and a 150-hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her ‘husband’ who had been working at HMRC as a security officer.

A Labour spokesman last night said: ‘More than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country.

Former Red or Dead boss Wayne Hemingway was among the signatories

‘Of course we were unaware of the background of this person. The fact still remains that the epidemic of zero hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this Government's economic plan.’

Other signatories included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville.

The pair said they were both working on zero hours contracts but their Facebook pages included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie.

Mr Pierce, who is studying maths, is registered on the electoral roll at his parents’ £1million house in woodland near Leatherhead, Surrey.

His mother Deirdre, 55, yesterday said that he was ‘just a kid’ who ‘knows nothing about politics’ but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student ‘he vaguely knows’.

She told the Mail: ‘All he did was sign a petition that somebody called Andrea asked everybody to sign. He knows a little but not much. It’s the first time he’s been interested in an election.’

She declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero hours contract.

Mr Somerville, who is in his final year studying economics, is register to vote at his mother's house in an affluent area of Belfast.

Mr Pierce was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said ‘Drugz Room’, but Mrs Pierce said that it was just a ‘joke’ sign that was a reference to the U.S. television programme Breaking Bad.

She said: ‘John-Jo has never done drugs in his life. It’s a joke about Breaking Bad. That’s what people of that age do. They all make jokes about Breaking Bad.’

Mr Somerville did not respond to a request to comment.

Investigators have not found any writings or conversations where Lubitz shared his motives . Medical records reveal Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy . Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , source says . A letter found in Lubitz ' apartment said he was not able to do his job , prosecutor says .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)The investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's motive, but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Germany, said Monday.

Investigators have not found any writings or conversations where Lubitz shared his motives or confessed to any plans, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said.

However, medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy. This was before he ever got his pilot's license, Kumpa said.

Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash.

It is believed that Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane Tuesday into the French Alps, killing all 150 on board.

The prosecutor's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming Lubitz unfit to fly, though there were no physical illnesses found.

In short, investigators in Germany and France are not yet ruling anything out.

Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues.

Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. He had stated working as a commercial pilot in 2013, Lufthansa said.

An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health.

It's unknown if Lubitz mentioned his problems on a form that asks yes-or-no questions about physical and mental illness, suicide attempts and medications. European pilots must fill out the form to be recertified.

Federal aviation authorities, not the airline, issue the form. The form is privileged information and Lufthansa never sees a pilot's completed form, said an airline spokesperson.

The airline would only get a "clear to fly" notice from the aviation doctors alerting the airline that a pilot has completed recertification.

Lubitz had visited an eye doctor because of vision problems, a European government official familiar with the investigation told CNN.

The pilot complained he was not seeing as he should, but the doctor told him the cause was psychosomatic, the official said. In part because of this, the doctor deemed Lubitz unfit for flying.

Lubitz told a different doctor --  a neuropsychologist -- that he was too stressed with work, the European official said.

The dates of these visits are unclear, but they could have been earlier this year.

The official said he is not aware of any suicidal tendencies reported by Lubitz to the doctors, but that investigators believe he was suicidal.

Airline officials have said that if Lubitz went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly.

A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, "concerning a diagnosis." But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression.

The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment.

The note, which was "slashed," said Lubitz was not able to do his job, Kumpa said Friday.

Britain's most senior psychiatrist, Sir Simon Wessely, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that when a pilot is "acutely depressed or suffering from really any physical illness" that impairs abilities, they cannot fly an aircraft safely.

"We don't let pilots fly with depression ... because they're impaired in concentration, memory and attention, which isn't good for a pilot," said Wessely, who is president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army.

One of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge from the crash so far comes from the cockpit voice recorder.

The sounds recorded on the recorder, known as a "black box," firms up a theory by investigators that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane.

"For God's sake, open the door!" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot.

Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps.

The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording.

CNN cannot independently verify the information, which Bild says is based on 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder.

According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz told him he could go anytime.

After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing.

Once that's finished, Lubitz again told the captain he "can go anytime."

There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, "You can take over."

At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend.

Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the "sink rate," Bild reported.

Next comes the banging.

Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild.

Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet).

A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says, "Terrain -- pull up!"

"Open the damn door!" the pilot says.

It's 10:38 a.m., and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report.

Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop.

Screams can be heard one final time.

France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency was "dismayed" by the voice recording leak to Bild.

Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere "voyeurism."

Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest.

Quest called it "unbelievable" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner.

Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States.

An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident.

Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight.

About 150 German investigators -- some specializing in homicide cases and others in identifying remains -- are in the French Alps at the site of the crash, Dusseldorf police said Monday. Meanwhile, police continue to examine evidence collected from the apartment of Lubitz and from his parents' home, police said.

French investigators at the crash site said they are optimistic they will be able to identify most of the passengers but added that "it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash."

Of the 150 passengers, 78 had been identified through DNA, Lt. Col.  Jean-Marc Menichini told CNN.

Weather conditions slowed the rescue work Monday, Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie unit said.

A new path under construction to the crash site will reduce the time it takes to reach the area, he said.

Le Vernet Mayor Francois Balique told CNN the path was within 100 meters of being finished. He commissioned a backhoe to build the path, he said.

"I felt the family members wanted this and they asked me to get them as close as possible, as if every meter mattered to them," he said.

The path will allow all-terrain vehicles to reach the site with fewer risks than with helicopter transfers.

Family members of those aboard Flight 9525, meanwhile, are making the grim pilgrimage to the crash site.

A total of 325 people have so far traveled to the site, Germanwings Chief Operating Officer Oliver Wagner said Monday at a news conference. He detailed what the airline is doing to support relatives of the victims.

CNN's Pamela Brown, Pamela Boykoff, Antonia Mortensen, Sandrine Amiel, Frederik Pleitgen, Karl Penhaul and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.

Paris Saint-Germain face Barcelona in Champions League quarter-final . PSG have been stripped by suspension of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti . Thiago Motta is injured , while David Luiz is also a major doubt . Edinson Cavani must torment the stars from Catalonia .
-----------------------------------------------
So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son.

Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football’s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes.

Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country.

Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend

Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia.

The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt.

Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over?

To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity.

Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday.

PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille.

It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao).

Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game.

Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France.

‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me.

‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’

Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage.

That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him.

Yulia Tarbath , 33 , from Surrey , moved to Bali with husband Paul in 2009 . She ate 30 pieces of fruit every day and exercised twice a day . Mother-of-one gained less than a stone in weight during first pregnancy . Took less than two weeks to get back to her starting weight of 8 stone .
-----------------------------------------------
A size six woman who was determined to keep in shape during pregnancy revealed she exercised twice a day and ate 30 pieces of fruit - including eight mangoes and ten bananas - every day.

Yulia Tarbath, 33, who is originally from Surrey but moved to Bali with her husband Paul in 2009, led a raw vegan diet - consisting of massive quantities of fruit, vegetables and juice, as well as hours of running, cycling and lifting weights.

The mother-of-one revealed she gained less than a stone in weight during her first pregnancy - and took less than two weeks to get back to her starting weight of 8 stone after giving both to daughter Elaine, who weighed a healthy 7lb 5oz when born.

Every morning, Yulia, pictured with Paul and daughter, Elanie, started the day with eight mangoes. For lunch, she ate her way through ten bananas and entire bunches of spinach

Life coach Yulia said she believes there's 'no excuse to be fat in pregnancy' adding that carrying a child 'is no excuse to pig out'.

Every morning, Yulia started the day with  eight mangoes. For lunch, she ate her way through ten bananas and entire bunches of spinach.

For dinner, she ate huge avocado salads - washed down with the juice of a dozen oranges. 

She said: 'There's no excuse to be fat in pregnancy. I exercised throughout my entire pregnancy and ate a healthy vegan diet.

'I didn't want to be eating for two - being pregnant is no excuse to pig out.'

Yulia added: 'My midwife thought I was crazy and urged me to eat more. People in the gym would come up to me and ask if I was okay - people thought I was crazy but I did what I wanted.

Yulia Tarbath, 33, pictured after she had her daughter, retained her size six figure throughout the nine-month term with regular work outs and a raw vegan diet

Yulia, pictured before falling pregnant, decided to research alternative options to battle her chronic tiredness, fertility problems, dry skin, dark circles and deep depression and discovered a raw vegan diet

'I never exerted myself, did too much exercise or tried lifting weights that were too heavy for me.

'If anything, I took things a bit easy.' 

Yulia moved to the Indonesian island of Bali in 2009 with husband Paul, 41, to set up a healthy life-coaching business.

When Yulia was 27, she decided to research alternative options to battle her chronic tiredness, fertility problems, dry skin, dark circles and deep depression.

She said: 'I read up on the benefits of being vegan. I had such a desire to become pregnant, but experienced issues. I was heavily depressed and suffered from chronic tiredness.

'Suddenly my life started to change when Paul and I became completely vegan. We threw ourselves into it and started working out twice a day.'

Yulia, at 31.5 weeks pregnant, moved to the Indonesian island of Bali in 2009 with her husband to set up a healthy life-coaching business

While Yulia, pictured at two months pregnant, may have had some funny looks from people in her local gym, she says she wouldn't change a thing about her pregnancy and will do the same if she has another child

Yulia, pictured with Paul after giving birth, says her midwife was concerned, especially with her diet. 'She wanted me to get more protein but I knew what I was doing,' she said

In June 2013, she fell pregnant, and in April the following year, the proud parents welcomed little Elanie into the world.

She said: 'I was not about to stop my lifestyle. I continued working out and two weeks after finding out, I completed a triathlon.

'As the pregnancy developed I continued to work out twice a day and eat a vegan diet. Even five months into the pregnancy you couldn't tell. From behind I just looked normal.

'I continued to exercise once in the morning with a job and light weights and then yoga, swim and cycle in the afternoon.'

While Yulia may have had some funny looks from people in her local gym, she said she wouldn't change a thing about her pregnancy.

She said her life started to change when she and Paul became completely vegan. 'We threw ourselves into it and started working out twice a day,' she said of their new lifestyle

Yulia  retained her svelte size six figure throughout the nine-month term by exercising  - and eating 30 pieces of fruit every day

She said: 'I felt such a connection to my child. I would be working out and feel her kick - I think she liked it - she was just as active as her mummy.

'My midwife was concerned, especially with my diet. She wanted me to get more protein but I knew what I was doing.

'Two weeks after birth I had already dropped to 8.5st. My weight gain was purely the baby, and now I am back in the gym and breastfeeding my baby.

'When I fall pregnant again I wouldn't change a thing. I'd run a marathon whilst carrying a child if I could.'

Speaking to FEMAIL about Yulia's eating and exercise regime, Dr Eva Detko Nutritionist said: 'A vegan diet is potentially dangerous during pregnancy and definitely not recommended.

Yulia, pictured with Paul after giving birth, gained less than a stone during her first pregnancy, and took less than two weeks to get back to her starting weight of 8st

Life coach Yulia stuck to a vegan diet consisting of massive quantities of fruit, vegetables and juice

'I would never advise anyone to stay vegan during pregnancy, it's not only about you - it's about the baby.

'You obviously don’t need to eat twice as much - don’t eat for two! - around 300 extra calories is fine, but you need quality protein, which is hard to get on a vegan diet. 

'As a vegan (pregnant or not), you must really know your stuff. 

'It's important to combine proteins to get all of the amino acids. You also need vitamins, including B12, which you can only get from animal sources; without good quality B12 you may have a baby with poor immunity. 

'There are no vegan sources of B12, so they would need supplementation.

'Then there’s essential fatty acids such as omega 3, which is found in animal sources (or masses of seaweed).

'On the plus side, vegans have a lot of green leafy vegetables, which are packed with iron, folic acid and calcium, which are all great during pregnancy.' 

On top of her healthy diet, she endured hours of running, cycling and lifting weights

As Dr PhD Marilyn Glenville (www.marilynglenville.com) explains: 'Eating healthily means eating regular meals of freshly prepared whole foods. Buy organically grown produce wherever possible as this reduces the toxic load on the body. Eat a good proportion of raw fruits and vegetables. Do not eat raw meat or raw fish. Steam rather than boil, stir fry rather than deep fry and grill or stew rather than roast or fry. Make sure your diet is balanced with adequate protein, complex carbohydrates and high in essential fats but low in saturated fats and drink plenty of filtered or mineral water.'

Foods to include

 

• Complex Carbohydrates Good sources: fresh fruit and vegetables (raw or lightly cooked), wholegrain breads, brown rice, wild rice, millet, oats, barley, buckwheat, rye and Quinoa.

• Protein Good sources: Organic poultry (1 or 2 pieces per week), fish, goat milk, sheep milk, organic eggs, vegetarian cheese, nuts, soya, seeds and pulses. Some grains are better sources than others, for example Quinoa and millet; the rest have a small amount and should be combined with other protein sources.

• Fats Good sources: Oily fish such as wild organic salmon, sardines, mackerel and herring. Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds, evening primrose oil, olive oil, hemp oil, starflower / borage oil and flax seed oil.

• Water: Many of us do not drink enough water. It is thought to be essential in providing the medium in which many chemical reactions within the body take place. Sadly much of our tap water does not measure up to safety standards required. It is advisable to drink only bottled or filtered water whilst pregnant.

• Fibre Good sources: Whole grains, fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds. You can also soak a tablespoon of whole linseeds in a glass of water overnight and swallow with an extra glass of water to help with the bowel.

Arsenal take on Reading in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . Danny Welbeck says he has settled in at Arsenal . The Arsenal striker has been unlucky in front of goal , but wants to play in a more central role . CLICK HERE for all the latest Arsenal news .
-----------------------------------------------
Young professional footballers can be an easy target with some of their behaviour but on Thursday afternoon it was refreshing to sit down and talk with Danny Welbeck. 

He struck me as a thoroughly decent young man who lives his life the right way. He is a credit to his family and his easy-going manner means he must a dream to work with. 

We discussed life at Arsenal, scoring against Manchester United and his FA Cup dreams. 

You can watch the full interview on Football Focus on BBC One today at 12.10pm and Reading’s semi-final with Arsenal live on BBC One from 5.05pm.

Danny Welbeck talks to Sportsmail's Martin Keown ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading

MARTIN KEOWN: You’ve played at Wembley many times and you’ve played in a semi-final as well but you’re now one step away from an FA Cup final. Does that bring extra nerves?

DANNY WELBECK: Not really. I think we’ve basically just got to play the game, not the occasion. The team was in this position last year and coming up against Wigan proved to be one of the toughest games of the season. 

Against Reading today is going to be another tough game. We’ve just got to approach it the right way and we want to get through to the final.

Welbeck expects a tough test as Arsenal face a Championship side at Wembley for the second year in a row

KEOWN: How are you settling in? You seem to have been here all your life almost and you’ve only been here seven or eight months.

WELBECK: The staff at the club, at the training ground and everyone has been very welcoming. The fans have been brilliant. 

My team-mates are class and I’m just really enjoying my time here. I’ve settled in very well. It’s a transitional year for me, getting to know new players, new team-mates, new systems and new ways of going about things at a different club. 

I think I’ve put in a few good performances. I’ve been unlucky on the club front with goals and that’s something I know will come in abundance when I get to know everything spot on with the club and I’m pretty sure that will happen.

The Arsenal striker thinks he has been unlucky in front of goal, but wants to play in a more central role

KEOWN: You talk about goals, you’re playing in a wide position. What’s your favourite position?

WELBECK: It’s no secret I prefer to play down the middle. But the formation we play at Arsenal, you’re playing on the left or the right. We’re always interchanging, playing in a three-man attack. It’s much easier doing that than playing left midfield or left wing in a four-man midfield.

KEOWN: Wenger has worked with lots of strikers over the years and been able to develop them. What’s the area that he’s working on most with you most of all?

WELBECK: We talk about the game, we analyse performances and on the training pitch we’ve also got the other staff here so after training we do a bit of individual work so that happens every day. You are always looking at ways to improve as a player, to develop and I feel like I am developing well as a player.

Welbeck, who says he has been made to feel very welcome at Arsenal, holds of Nacho Monreal in training

KEOWN: Is it your movement he works on? Is it holding up the ball? Finishing? Or is it a combination?

WELBECK: It’s a combination of everything. You don’t just work on one thing. Every single day all the lads after training go out and do finishing.

KEOWN: Does that become competitive? To see who can score the most goals?

WELBECK: Yeah it does! It gets competitive but it’s obviously all fun. But at the end of the day nobody wants to come last. We work on a lot of areas of our game.

Like his team-mate Theo Walcott, Welbeck is often forced out wide, despite preferring being a central striker

KEOWN: In the last round you put out Manchester United. How did it feel to score at Old Trafford?

WELBECK: It was a weird occasion for me going to back to Old Trafford on the away side. The weirdest thing was warming up on the other side of the pitch. It just felt a bit weird. But you have to treat it like it’s any other game and play the game, not the occasion. 

Obviously I was going back to a club that brought me up and going back to the fans that supported me for years, playing against old team-mates, my old friends, it was a weird occasion. 

But I scored the goal, a big goal to get us through to the semi-final. So it was a spur of the moment to celebrate.

The English international scored the winning goal on his return to Old Trafford in the quarter finals last month

KEOWN: Did it cross your mind not to celebrate?

WELBECK: Leading up to the game I had no plans whatsoever. I just wanted to play the game, get it over and done with and get through to Wembley and get to the semi-final. That’s what happened. 

I scored the goal and whatever I did I would have been criticised – criticised if I celebrated or criticised if I didn’t. It was just spur of the moment.

KEOWN: Against Manchester United you seemed extra motivated. Was it anything to do with Louis Van Gaal’s comments before the match?

WELBECK: I didn’t see the comments. Going into every game I want to be motivated. Playing against Manchester United – I did it earlier in the season at the Emirates – and then it was a bit different this time going back to Old Trafford.

There was motivation there but I’m motivated in every game. I want to do well for my team, try and win the game and in that case get through to the semi-final. Listen, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, some you like, some you don’t like but that’s just football and it’s life. You deal with it.

Welbeck celebrates in front of his old fans, a decision he says was entirely spur of the moment

KEOWN: I think you showed a lot of mental strength going into that situation. It’s always difficult going back.

WELBECK: You’ve got to be strong mentally living the life and being a professional footballer. There’s a lot of people out to get you and whatever you do, everyone’s watching. 

You’ve just got to be switched on 100 per cent of the time. That’s just the way I’ve been brought up. 

My parents are lovely, caring people and they look after me well, they brought me up well and it’s the same with me and my brothers that’s credit to them.

The striker has quickly become a favourite at the Emirates, and he thanked the fans for their support

KEOWN: This weekend it’s Reading. Have you looked much at their team?

WELBECK: You get to watch a few games throughout the season. I know they’ve got players with Premier League experience. I’ve seen them a couple of games this season being a bit direct. 

[Pavel] Pogrebnyak’s a player they look for quite often from the back and the wingers will be coming inside to get the ball and flick-ons. 

Hal Robson-Kanu plays a bit more inside and [Gareth] McCleary is a bit more out and out on the right wing.

Welbeck has been working hard in training to try and improve his finishing, along with his team-mates

KEOWN: Good knowledge…

WELBECK: Yeah I know quite a lot about football!

KEOWN: As a centre forward or a winger, do you look for the weaknesses in the opposition?

WELBECK: You’ve got to analyse the positives and negatives in every single team. You look at that and obviously see where you can nullify their attack and see where their weaknesses are at the back.

The Gunners forward picked out Pavel Pogrebnyak as one of Reading's most dangerous players

KEOWN: How much would it mean to you to get to the FA Cup final?

WELBECK: It would mean a lot. I’ve been in this position before with Man United when we played Everton in the semi-finals a few years back and we lost on penalties. I remember the situation, I remember how I felt that day and that’s something I don’t want to feel again. 

I just want to get to the next stage, get to the final. This is a very important game so we’re all looking forward to it, we’re going to approach it like it’s any other and play the game not the occasion.

A former NFL player has revealed that his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost for 'raising him for the last 18 years' after he was drafted into the professional league. 

Phillip Buchanon was a first-round draft pick for the Oakland Raiders, and seventeenth overall, when his mother made the request in 2002. 

Buchanon, who also played for the Houston Texans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins before retiring in 2011, discussed the incident in his recently released book New Money: Stay Rich.

'If my mother taught me anything, it's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child,' he wrote in an exclusive excerpt released to Fox Sports. 

Former NFL player Phillip Buchanon (pictured here playing for the Oakland Raiders) has revealed his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost 'for raising him for the last 18 years' after he was drafted 

'The covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible, and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect.' 

But after years, Buchanon said he realized that his mother and family members were different - especially when money became involved. 

He told Fox Sports that he wrote the book to make sure 'the next generation of athletes doesn't make the same mistakes' he did when he finally got paid the big NFL bucks.

Buchanon said he followed the 'unwritten NFL New Money Millionaire' rule and instead bought his mother a brand new big house, as well as paid for all her finances that did not include food or entertainment. 

But he soon realized that gift would come with its own problems.

Instead of selling her old house, like he advised, Buchanon's mother rented it to his aunt. This left Buchanon paying for mortgage and maintenance payments for both houses for seven years. 

Buchanon asks rookies to consider certain questions before buying their family 'big-ticket purchases', such as whether the family member would be able to make the payments if they couldn't, or if the family member expected them to pay for upkeep 20 years later. 

The former football star said his mother never offered him the money she made from her sister's rent, and later blamed him for 'messing up her life' after he kicked her boyfriend out of the house he paid for.

'What she didn't see was that her boyfriend was pimping her and me out,' he wrote. 'He wasn't bringing anything to the table, just taking.' 

Buchanon said he bought his mother a house instead, which brought its own set of problems for years

Buchanon (pictured playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) said his relatives also asked him for money, claiming they needed a check to pay for repairs and bills 

Buchanon said he eventually became fed up and told his mother he would stop paying for her new house's upkeep after he paid off the mortgage. 

When his mother said the house was too large for her to afford the maintenance, he offered to buy her a smaller house that he would pay for with cash and put in his name, protecting her from loans and giving his brothers and sisters a stable home.

Instead, his mother asked for $15,000 in cash. She ended up losing the home. 

'She told me that if the new house didn't have space for two living room sets, she didn't want it,' Buchanon writes.  

Buchanon said he moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer 'felt secure' in a home where his mother let people 'come in and out of the house and take what they wanted'. 

And the football player said he soon realized it wouldn't just be his mother asking him for money, but his relatives as well, who often had 'family emergencies'. 

Buchanon (pictured with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers)  moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer 'felt secure' at  home because his mother let people 'come in and out of the house and take what they wanted'

Buchanon said at first he would just write his relatives a check, which he said would 'always get cashed' even as the problems never got fixed.

That's when Buchanon said he started offering to pay for the 'emergencies' directly to the mechanics or companies the money was supposedly owed to, only to have his relatives say 'forget about it'.

Buchanon said he spent 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' before learning how to deal with his family's monetary demands. 

But he said it was the way his mother treated him that ended up teaching Buchanon 'the most important lessons in life'.

'The mothers and fathers of the world have been rearing their kids for generations - in every culture imaginable - and it's a one-way street when it comes to money,' he writes. 

'If they pay you back someday, and you really are going through hard times, then that's just a bonus, a gratuity for being a great mother or father.'

A 25-year-old man left brain damaged as a baby after a blunder by doctors has today won his 23-year battle for £7.3 million compensation.

The young man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, now relies on 24-hour care.

He was born at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in September 1989, but was readmitted three months later, suffering a serious brain haemorrhage.

Maternity staff at the hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection shortly after the man was born.

A 25-year-old man was left brain damaged as a baby after doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection to help the blood clot and prevent internal bleeding. He now requires 24-hour care and will do for the rest of his life. (File picture) 

The booster is given to newborn babies to reduce their risk of blood clots.

The Secretary of State for Health admitted liability, accepting the failure to give the man vitamin K breached their duty of care.

At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the £7.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority.

It awards the man a lump sum of £2,345,000, as well as annual payments of £181,000, rising to £192,000 - making a total of £7,385,000.

Vitamin K helps the blood to clot, and as a result can prevent excessive internal bleeding.

In the UK new parents are asked if they would like their newborn to recieve the supplement.

Babies are born with low levels of the vitamin, but the amount is normally enough to prevent problems.

Some babies are at greater risk, and are more likely to suffer haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding.

Because it can be difficult to ascertain which babies are at heightened risk, the Department of Health recommends all babies receive the supplement soon after birth.

Though rare, HDN is a very serious disease.

Half of all babies with HDN suffer a haemorrhage into their brain, often resulting in brain damage.

Babies at higher risk of HDN include:

Judge Yelton said the man should not be named because he was a 'vulnerable person'.

But he said he was 'entirely satisfied' the settlement was in his best interests.

He said he was 'very pleased' for the young man and his family.

The brain damage the now 25-year-old suffered has resulted in significant cognitive and physical problems, including a weakness on his left hand side, and reduced hearing.

He also lacks the capacity to manage his own affairs, and needs round the clock care. 

His family welcomed the settlement, adding it will allow for specialist support, specially adapted accommodation and 24-hour care.  

His solicitor Arani Yogadeva of Irwin Mitchell said: 'Vitamin K injections are offered to parents as a measure to boost their newborn baby's anti-clotting processes shortly after birth and reduce the risks of them suffering excessive bleeding caused by a deficiently in the vitamin.

'In this case, midwives and doctors chose not to provide him with the relevant dose without advising his mother about the vitamin and the importance of it - a decision which has had serious repercussions.

'We are delighted to have helped the family secure vital financial support, along with an admission of liability.

'It will ensure he gets the lifelong care he requires and also urge hospitals to ensure that guidance is following in relation to the issue of vitamin K.' 

At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the £7.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority following a 23-year battle

Asked whether he remembers the moment he became a Barcelona supporter, Pique told UEFA: 'I don't think it's a moment, it's a process. 

'You go to the stadium to watch matches with your family, your dad or grandad take you to games every weekend and slowly you start falling in love with the club and its history. 

'Then, when I was seven or eight and started playing for the youth team, that's when the Baraa colours began to really mean something special to me.'

Pique has faced the greatest players in the world during his time at the Nou Camp, but ranks Didier Drogba, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the three best he has came up against.

'I grew up at La Masia, dreaming of playing for the first team one day so you can only imagine what it means to wear this shirt 300 times,' he told Mundo Deportivo.

'Many people have been fortunate to enjoy it. And all the titles we won are very special. Both Barca and I have had the honour of reaching the final stages of major competitions, meeting the best teams and best players.

'There have been many but I would highlight, Drogba, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi every day in training!'

Craig Hicks , 46 , is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students . He turned himself in to police the night of the killings . Hicks had no prior criminal record , police said .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Craig Hicks, who is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, earlier this year, can face the death penalty, a judge ruled Monday, according to CNN affiliates.

Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is "death penalty qualified," WRAL and WTVD reported.

The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head.

Hicks, who was the victims' neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling.

He had no prior criminal record, police said.

Police said "an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking" might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime.

On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime.

The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement in February saying the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened "a parallel preliminary inquiry" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated.

"It has always been our position that Mr. Hicks should be held responsible for his actions to the full extent of the law. His killing of three college students was despicable, and now he must face the consequences of his actions," said Rob Maitland, an attorney for Hicks' wife. Karen and Craig Hicks are in the process of divorce.

Many viewers have deemed his performance 'awesome' and 'inspirational'.

One fan added: 'That was shockingly good! So impressive to see such poise and talent from a 12-year-old. Best of luck to him.' 

Nicholas then got the ultimate thumbs up this week from one of his top sportsmen.

Watt sat on the sidelines to watch the Houston Rockets-Dallas Mavericks playoff game.

He later celebrated the Rockets' 111-99 win with jubilant dance moves. He was even spotted twerking with one audience member.

On Wednesday, Watt asked Twitter to help him get in touch with Nicholas. Maybe we'll soon be seeing the performer at NFL games too.

Convict: Small time drug dealer Rudy Guede, 29, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder

The only person convicted for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher has declared that he will seek a retrial, following the sensational exoneration of Amanda Knox.

Small time drug dealer Rudy Guede, 29, is serving a 16-year sentence for the murder in Perugia, Italy.

The Ivory Coast national's DNA was found all over the bedroom where Miss Kercher was found half-naked, her throat slit in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox.

Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for the murder, which prosecutors claimed was a sex game gone wrong, before being conclusively cleared last month by Italy's highest court.

The Supreme Court's ruling throws a new lifeline to Guede, who was convicted by the same court of being an accomplice to a murder 'committed in the company of others'.

Lawyers for Guede are likely to argue that the two sentences are incompatible, forcing a revision of his conviction.

Speaking from prison in Viterbo, where he is described as 'a model prisoner' Guede claimed that his conviction is rendered 'impossible' by the exoneration of Knox and ex boyfriend Sollecito. 

He said: 'Look at me: I committed the impossible crime. How can I be the accomplice in a murder without any accomplices? '

Guede who is now halfway through his sentence said: 'I want a retrial.'

He said his lawyers are waiting for the reasoning behind the innocent sentence of the Supreme Court, to be published which will be within 90 days of the Knox verdict. 

'I am convinced that we will find elements to overturn the verdict,' he said.

Cleared: Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for Meredith Kercher's murder before being conclusively cleared by Italy's highest court last month

Tragic: Meredith Kercher was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with  Knox

Already the overturning of Knox and Sollecito's guilty sentences has left the Kercher family 'shocked' and with many unanswered questions. 

If Guede too were absolved, on a judicial technicality, it would leave no one paying for their daughter's murder.

The Italian justice system is currently being overhauled because of its cost, contradictions and inefficiency. It has a backlog of around nine million legal cases.

The Supreme Court, which hears 80,000 appeals a year, 100 times more than comparable countries, upholds only a fraction of convictions. 

The state were forced to pay €84million in compensation for miscarriages of justice and legal delays in 2011.

Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after last month's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011

Guede, who lives on a wing for violent sex offenders said that Knox and Sollecito had been 'fortunate'.

But he told La Repubblica newspaper that the granting of their appeals had given him fresh hope. He said: 'Destiny has been less kind to me but I will not lament. Today I have a new reason to go on.'

The 29-year-old, who came to Italy from Agou in Cote-d'Ivoire aged 7, has almost finished a degree in history from Rome Tre university. 

Once freed he wants to find a job in Italy and move forward. 'I want to prove to everyone that I am not a monster and forget my past. '

He said his only mistake was to opt for a fast track trial. He said: 'Here in Italy the fast track trial is seen as an admission of guilt. But I thought I would be able to prove my innocence straight away. '

Guede is eligible for day release this year.

A woman who launched a social media campaign in a bid to return a sentimental ring which she found snorkeling in Bali has found the owner who is amazingly from the same part of Australia.

Roxy Walsh, 34, met with the ecstatic owners, Joe and Jenny Langley, in Noosa, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, on Sunday to personally return the ring to the couple after less than week of searching.

'In my mind I thought I'd be going to New York or Italy or somewhere... Instead I ended up just driving myself three hours to Noosa,' Ms Walsh told Daily Mail Australia.

'In one night 600 or 700 people had shared it just from the media website, Kids in Adelaide,' she said.

'So I thought, this can go further, and it did.'

After creating a 'Find Joe and Jenny' Facebook page, within a week, The Langley's granddaughter Jade, messaged the page saying she believes the ring belongs to her grandpa and that they lived under 300 kilometres away from Ms Walsh.

'The amazing thing is, out of the thousands of messages I got through the Facebook page, Jade's was the only one claiming the ring,' she said.

Over 6000 users joined the page and followed the journey of reuniting the ring back to its' mystery owner

Queensland resident Roxy Walsh recovered the gold jewellery at the Finns Beach Club in Bali on Tuesday

'I never thought that I'd find the owners or I thought that I'd really have to try so when I got her message I didn't have the feeling that I'd found them.' 

Ms Walsh was skeptical until the next day when she spoke to Mr Langley himself and instantly knew this man was the owner of the sentimental ring.

After speaking on the phone, Joe sent photos from their Bali trip nine months ago where they had lost it in the exact same place that Ms Walsh had found it.

The gold piece of jewellery was an anniversary gift from his wife,  and was inscribed with ‘Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009, Love Jenny’.

Mr Langley had been swimming at the same resort in Bali when he got caught in a strong current and only escaped after clambering up some rocks.

It wasn't until he later looked at a photo of himself, that he noticed the ring was missing.

The post has been shared more than 250,000 times, taking the search for the special ring global.

‘Sometimes hear of these things finding their way home so worth a shot,’ Ms Walsh wrote. 

The social media page amazingly made it to Russia, England, Malta, Brazil and Chile among others.

But the incredible fact that Joe and Jenny reside a three hour drive from Ms Walsh means they will keep in touch 

'We will see each other again,' Ms Walsh said.

'They are definitely on the Christmas card list.'

-----------------------------------------------
The greatest challenge to Rory McIlroy's grand slam bid or Tiger Woods' latest comeback at this week's Masters could come from Mother Nature.

Players endured rainy spells during their  practice on Tuesday with forecasts that the wet weather is set continue once the tournament gets underway  on Thursday April 9.

The typically warm and humid Georgia weather is expected to be unsettled by a cold front heading into Augusta for the weekend, which is likely to bring more showers and thunderstorms, especially on Friday and Saturday.

Despite using an umbrella to shield himself from the elements on Tuesday, McIlroy could find himself facing record high temperatures on the first day of play - with the mercury expected to reach 90F, approaching the record 91F set in 2011.

Augusta National has its own weather centre where officials can keep an eye on any extreme changes and evacuate players, spectators and staff from the course if necessary. 

According to Accuweather.com, Thursday and Sunday will likely be the best weather days at the tournament while Friday and Saturday carry potential for storms with strong winds.

Many spectators were forced to watch their heroes hone their swings from under shelter, although the course's state of the art drainage system mean that play is unlikely to be delayed.

-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)A mammoth fire broke out Friday morning in a Kentucky industrial park, sending plumes of thick smoke over the area as authorities worked to contain the damage.

The blaze began shortly before 7 a.m. at the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, according to Mike Weimer from the city's emergency management agency. He said that there were no reports of anyone injured or trapped.

Video showed both smoke and bright orange flames. Firefighters took up positions around the affected buildings, spraying water from the periphery.

Weimer told CNN that authorities didn't know what had caused the fire, which had gone to at least four alarms.

According to a GE website, its facility in the Louisville Appliance Park is "revitalizing manufacturing in the United States." The park is large, such that 34 football fields could fit in one of its warehouses in the facility.

Brothers of sex offenders are five times more likely to commit similar crimes . Sons of fathers with a criminal record are four times more likely to do so . Biggest study of its kind suggests sex offending could run in the family along the male genetic line . News comes after the high profile case of Jimmy Savile .
-----------------------------------------------
The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, according to researchers.

They also found the sons of fathers with a criminal record for sex offending were nearly four times more likely to be convicted of such crimes.

The biggest study of its kind suggests sex offending could run in the family along the male genetic line.

The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse

Sex offending could run in families along the male genetic line, experts claim. The Savile's, including alleged sex abusers Johnny (far left) and Jimmy Savile (far right), are pictured in a family portrait from the 1930s

Mohammed Jumale, known as Deeq, (left) and  his brother Omar Jumale (right) were part of a 13-strong Somali prostitution gang that raped girls as young as 13-years-old

The findings show that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in risk between close relatives of offenders and men from the general population were genetically driven.

But the researchers stressed that this did not mean a man with a brother or father convicted of rape would inevitably follow in their footsteps.

The news comes after the high profile case of Jimmy Savile, who it was revealed raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse.

It is now believed that his elder brother Johhny ‘most likely’ abused seven women at a South London hospital, according to an NHS report. 

Over the past few years a string of brothers have been convicted of child sex offences, including Mohammed Jumale and his brother Omar Jumale, who were part of a 13-strong gang that raped girls as young as 13-years old. 

Anjum Dogar, 31, and his brother Akhtar, 32 were jailed in 2013 for the abuse of six girls over the course of eight years in Oxford.

Lead scientist Professor Niklas Langstrom, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said: ‘It’s important to remember that it’s nothing mystic.

‘Of course you don’t inherit in some kind of automatised robotic way so that you will grow up to be a sexual offender.’

Razwan Razaq (left) and his brother Umar (right) were jailed in 2010 for being part of a five-member gang that groomed girls as young as 11 in Rotherham

Anjum Dogar, 31, and his brother Akhtar, 32 were jailed in 2013 for the abuse of six girls over the course of eight years in Oxford. Another set of brothers, Zeeshan Ahmed and Bilal Ahmed, were also convicted

The scientists studied data on all men convicted of sexual offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. Rates of sexual offending there are similar to those in the UK.

Of the 21,566 offenders, nearly half had convictions for adult rape or child molesting. Other crimes included possession of child pornography, indecent exposure and sexual harassment.

In terms of absolute risk, being closely related to an offender only led to a small increase in the chances of committing a sexual crime. 

Just 2.5 per cent of brothers of sex offenders were convicted of similar crimes, compared with 0.5 per cent of men in the general population, according to the study reported in the International Journal of Epidemiology.

 Evidence from half-brothers sharing either a mother or father and being raised in different family environments supported the idea that genetics played an important role in sexual offending.

More than half of the difference in risk was linked to ‘non-shared’ environmental factors including perinatal complications, head injuries and childhood sexual victimisation that affect an individual but are not shared with other family members.

Less than one per cent of convicted sex offenders are women so it was not ‘meaningful’ to include them, said Prof Langstrom.

Behavioural factors found in sex crimes, such as impulsive behaviour, hypersexuality and sexual deviance, may be genetic-based drivers for the offences, said the researchers.

Co-author Professor Seena Fazel, from Oxford University, said: ‘We are definitely not saying that we have found a gene for sexual offending.

‘What we have found is high-quality evidence from a large population study that genetic factors have a substantial influence.’ 

Christopher Davis left was jailed for 14 months and his brother Timothy (right) given a community sentence for child pornography offences

The findings may point the way towards providing better social help to at-risk families, many of which were already known to social services, said the authors.

‘At the moment genetic factors are typically ignored when it comes to making risk assessments of those at high risk of sexual offending’ said Prof Fazel.

‘Many of the families we are talking about may already be known to social services for other reasons, and if we can predict those at high risk of offending with greater accuracy then it may be possible to shape these interventions and target education and preventative therapies where they could do the most good’ he said.

Interventions might include help with setting boundaries, and improving conflict resolving and social skills, he said.

A logical next step would be a large-scale study that took DNA samples and looked for genetic patterns that may contribute to problem sexual behaviours, Prof Fazel added.

But pinning down the precise genetic variants involved in sexual offending would be next to impossible, requiring samples from many thousands of individuals, which rules out the use of genetic screening.

-----------------------------------------------
It is the brand new accommodation designed to give visitors a taste of the South Pacific, but the latest villas on offer at Walt Disney World Florida are not for the budget traveller.

The first phase of Disney's Polynesian Villas & Bungalows has just been unveiled, revealing opulent overwater villas available from $2,000 a night - rising to $4,500 at peak times.

And though the luxurious offerings look like they belong in Bora Bora, in reality, they're located just steps from the Magic Kingdom  in Orlando.

Disney has just opened their first-ever overwater bungalows as part of their luxury Polynesian resort

Nestled along the shore of the Seven Seas Lagoon, the resort is a quick monorail ride away from the theme park and also conveniently located close by to Disney's Polynesian Village Resort.

There, guests will find all of their dining options, as well as several play areas, a children's club, and more. 

The impressive overwater suites are a first of their kind for Disney, boasting two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a private plunge pool.

Each bungalow reportedly sleeps up to eight people and offers a view of both the Magic Kingdom Resort and the lagoon, where an electrical water pageant takes place each night.

Nestled on the shores of the Seven Seas Lagoon, the villas feel more like Bora Bora than Florida

All of the bungalows have two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a full kitchen and a large living area

There are 20 overwater villas in total and each of the opulent offering sleeps eight people

Each bungalow has an expansive private deck, complete with private plunge pool overlooking the water

Before being ushered to their private bungalow, all 20 of which are connected via bamboo walkways, guests are welcomed at the Great Ceremonial House, where they are given flower leis.

From there, and if you're not headed directly to the theme parks, guests can take advantage of their private decks and sun loungers or explore the sandy shores of the lagoon.

There are also a pair of bamboo chairs hanging from the roof on each of the bungalow's decks, providing the perfect spot to tuck into a bit of Dole Whip soft serve ice cream.

The pineapple-flavoured concoction is famous on the resort - and one of the only places you can find the sweet treat outside of Hawaii. 

In one of the bedrooms, the bed's headboard is crafted out of wooden surfboards

Of the two bathrooms, the master even has a television hidden in the mirror

The villas have a mid-century, 60s-era design scheme and a large dining room table that seats eight

The bungalows provide the perfect vantage point from which to watch the electrical water pageant at night

At night, music from the fireworks display, which takes place at the Magic Kingdom, gets piped in to the villa

The villas can be booked by regular holidaymakers but are also available as part of a timeshare programme through Disney's Vacation Club. 

'If you'd like to rent one of the bungalows, it's anywhere between $2,100 and $4,500, depending on the time of year you come and visit,' Tracy Powell, Vice Presidents Deluxe Resorts told Fox Orlando. 

She maintains that the high price will stil offer great value for timeshare programme users as lifetime membership will eventually save them up to 50 per cent on costs.

The Disney driving instructor who was killed in a Lamborghini crash Sunday tried to grab the wheel in a desperate attempt to prevent a collision, as investigators say the car may have been speeding in the wrong direction around the track.

Tavon Watson, 24, was doing 100mph at the Exotic Driving Experience at Walt Disney World in Orlando when he slammed the $220,000 Lamborghini on the passenger side into a guardrail, killing 35-year-old race track employee Gary Terry.

Florida Highway Patrol Sgt Kim Montes revealed Tuesday that the guardrail damaged the Italian car on the east side of the passenger door.

Desperate effort: Investigators say Disney driving instructor Gary Terry (left) grabbed for the wheel of an out-of-control Lamborghini operated by Trevor Watson (right) and counter-steer before the car crashed into a guardrail

'Guess who's driving a Ferrari 458 Italia LSTRF today?': Watson uploaded this picture to Facebook in celebration of his birthday with this message: 'But really. I thankyou Lord for keeping in your presence long enough to endure another day that just so happens to be my birthday'

The FHP is now investigating whether cars at the private track are set up to travel in the opposite, clockwise direction of the guardrails, according to WESH-TV.

Montes also said that evidence suggests Terry tried to grab the wheel and 'counter steer' the out-of-control vehicle in the moments before the deadly wreck.

Video from inside the red Lamborghini reportedly showed that the car spun three times before careening into the guardrail at 100mph, causing the vulnerable passenger door to cave in into Terry.

'We're talking his whole body received the low,' Montes noted to New York Daily News.  

Both Watson and Terry were wearing helmets and lap and shoulder belts. 

Father-of-one Terry died at the scene while Watson was rushed to Celebration Hospital near Lake Buene Vista for treatment where he was later declared stable. He has since been discharged. 

The day out at the track was a present from Watson's wife and he posted a picture of himself next to a red Ferrari on the tarmac just hours before the fatal collision. 

Drive: According to his LinkedIn Terry was the operations manager at the Richard Petty Driving Experience at Walt Disney World

Outdoors: Terry, 36, originally hails from Michigan and brought his love of adventure to his new home in Kissimmee, Florida

'Guess who's driving a Ferrari 458 Italia LSTRF today?' wrote Watson.

'That's right that's right. I ma drive all the cars they have in one day. Because I'm a gangsta like that. Lol.'

Later that afternoon, Watson crashed the Lamborghini Gallardo he was driving, killing Terry, a former race car driver who was the operations manager at the Richard Petty Driving Experience at Walt Disney World.

Watson doesn't face any traffic charges since the accident took place on a closed track, and there are no indications he was doing anything criminal, authorities said. 

'It's not the kid's fault. It's a freak thing that happened,' said Timothy Horvath, a Terry family friend. As for Terry, 'if he thought he was in any danger, he wouldn't have done it.' 

Horvath said working at the Disney attraction was Terry's 'dream job.' 

Terry grew up in a racing family in Michigan. His brother, Adam, was also a race car driver. Terry was married with a toddler-age daughter, said Horvath, who grew up with the Terry family and runs a graphics business in Michigan that specializes in motor sports.

'Gary was one of the best,' Horvath said. 'He was a natural-born talent behind the wheel.'

Watson, a hotel bellhop, described himself on his LinkedIn page as self-motivated, professionally mannered, humble and 'a very quick learner.'

He told authorities he had been at the Exotic Driving Experience before.

Tragic: Gary Terry, 36, died and his driver was hospitalized after their Lamborghini crashed at Disney world

Investigators from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are looking into what happened.

OSHA spokesman Lindsay Williams said the agency hadn't previously investigated Petty Holdings, the company that operates the track.

Driving days at the track start at $99 and can cost as much as $2,500 for a full race experience with in-car video. 

The track is operated by Petty Holdings which also has Exotic Driving Experience franchises at speedways in Atlanta, Dayton Beach, Charlotte, New Jersey and Texas.

Named after the NASCAR legend, Richard Petty, the experience lets fans drive European supercars or NASCAR vehicles at close to their top speeds of 200mph around an oval.

'It's kind of scary to think accidents do happen even though they are rides and there are precautions,' said visitor Autumn Stevenson to WFTV.  

The Exotic Driving Experience attraction lets racing fans be drivers or passengers in luxurious cars such as Lamborghinis, Porsches or Ferraris

Package: Thrill seekers can pay up to $2,500 to experience a day driving an Italian supercar such as a Lamborghnin Gallardo (pictured above)

As part of the package, visitors are accompanied by a professional driver who sits in the passenger seat providing racing advice.

It is believed that was what Terry was doing when he was killed in the Lamborghini.

The racing track is just south of the iconic Magic Kingdom.

'We offer our deepest sympathies to those involved in today's tragic accident,' said Andrea Finger, spokesperson for Walt Disney World Resort.

According tot he Orlando Sentinel, Petty Holdings LLC also offered its best wishes to the victims and their families.

'On behalf of everyone in the organization, it is with a very heavy heart that we extend our deepest sympathies to those involved in today's tragic accident in Orlando.'

The Exotic Driving Experience, along with its sibling track, the Richard Petty Driving Experience, was slated to close this summer at Disney World for unrelated reasons.

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored eight goals in Europe this season . Lionel Messi also has eight goals , one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Adriano , who moved to Shakhtar Donetsk in 2007 , has netted on nine times . Adriano is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . CLICK HERE for all the latest Champions League news .
-----------------------------------------------
Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party.

Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively.

The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term.

Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe 

Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano 

Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four

Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.

He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament.

‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future.

Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League

‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’

Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year.

Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month.

Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. 

The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.

Frida Ghitis : U.S. . drone strike killed two aid workers held hostage by U.S. . drones . She says the case of The Washington Post 's Tehran bureau chief is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages . She says Iran 's hostage-taking may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past . She says use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen enthusiasm around reconciliation .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)On Thursday, President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike had killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, two aid workers held hostage on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Al Qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the United States and an end to drone strikes. But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief.

On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information "with malicious intent." The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease.

The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern.

Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious.

The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted. Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world. Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was "betraying" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement. Khomeini endorsed their action. "Our young people must foil these plots," he reportedly said. The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands. Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare.

Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode. Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon. Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages. Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum.

Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans. Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions.

Of course, Iran is not alone in such games. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises. Take North Korea: Obama campaigned as the anti-Bush on the world stage. "The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous," Obama, then a senator, declared in July 2007.

Obama hadn't even marked two months in office when North Korea detained two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV. A kangaroo court sentenced Laura Ling and Euna Lee to 12 years in prison. It was traditional hostage diplomacy. Former President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to appeal for their release.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un. North Korea's police force put out word that "General Kim Jong Un's artifice let former U.S. President Clinton cross the Pacific to apologize to the Great Leader. It was all made possible thanks to General Kim Jong Un's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics." North Korea's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance.

Ling and Lee were neither the first nor the last Americans that North Korea seized during the Obama era. After North Korea torpedoed a South Korean ship, killing 46, Obama sought North Korea's censure in the U.N. Security Council. Pyongyang responded by threatening Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering North Korea.

On cue, former President Jimmy Carter arrived to mediate for Gomes' release, called for new talks and, by omission, derailed efforts to hold North Korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen South Korean sailors.

The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions. The following year, North Korea arrested an 85-year-old Korean War veteran touring the hermit kingdom and, the next year, took two other tourists hostage. Each arrest resulted in a high-level visit, an apology to North Korea that bolstered the dear leader's claims of strength and renewed engagement.

Saddam Hussein likewise worked from the same playbook. In March 1995, Iraqi security forces seized two American defense contractors who strayed into Iraq from Kuwait. Sentenced to eight years, they served 114 days before Rep. Bill Richardson, D-New Mexico, a close Clinton ally (and future Cabinet-level U.N. ambassador) flew to Baghdad to retrieve them. The American media lauded Richardson, but his trip was not without cost: Saddam used it to depict Iraq as strong and America as weak. "President Saddam Hussein ... accepts the pleas by Bill Clinton, the Congress and American people," the Iraqi News Agency reported.

And so did the Taliban. Fifteen years before Obama traded alleged American deserter Bowe Bergdahl for five high-value Taliban and alleged al Qaeda operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the Taliban arrested two Americans female missionaries. Their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of Clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the Taliban; the Taliban, too, knew how holding Americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions.

So what does Iran's hostage brinkmanship portend? Diplomats drink their own Kool-Aid, and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold. Ego, ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries. Hostages such as Rezaian are canaries in the coal mine, however. Their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy.

A Ferrari-driving fantasist dubbed 'Teflon Don' who murdered his wealthy heiress lover in order to steal £816,000 from her bank accounts has been ordered to pay back just £1.  

Donald Graham, 62, from Sparty Lea, Northumberland, killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home.

Ms Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found.

Donald Graham, 62, (pictured) killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, his lover, for her money

He stole £300,000 of her savings, her Land Rover and Porsche, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family.

Graham, who dubbed himself Teflon Don, was last year jailed for life with a minimum of 32 years for killing Ms Brown for her money nine years after her death.

Prosecutors wanted to reclaim his ill-gotten gains, which they said totalled £816,127.86p, under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

But Newcastle Crown Court heard Graham, previously referred to in court as the Prince of Darkness, now has no available assets and so must pay back just back £1.  

Janet Brown (pictured left) and Graham (right) were lovers for eight years despite Graham being married

Graham, who drove a Ferrari, a Porsche, a Range Rover and a Alfa Romeo Spider, despite allegedly being short of cash, denied murdering Ms Brown between June 14 and 18, 2005 but admitted stealing her money.

But jurors, who had been deliberating over the case for a week, found him guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice during a trial last year.

The court heard the Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has ever been found.

Graham spun a cruel web of lies that left Ms Brown’s parents believing she was still alive but living abroad.

Graham, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses, including Ms Brown.

Graham and Ms Brown,who had saved ‘substantial assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years.

He told her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry.

The Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has been found

The pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go alone.

The court heard that after booking the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with whom he had become infatuated. 

It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that Ms Brown was murdered.

Graham had persuaded her to transfer £300,000 into his account and the money dropped just a day before she disappeared.

Jurors were told that Graham wanted Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in.

During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court, the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham.

The trial judge said Ms Brown, whose body has never been found, may have been dumped in a deep pit or mine shaft by former JCB digger driver Graham.

Her killer was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on his beloved sports cars.

He plundered Ms Brown's bank account to fund his flashy lifestyle, making her elderly parents, Eric and Olive Brown, believe their daughter was still alive by sending them letters and cards in her name from Europe.

Graham also ingratiated himself with her parents after her death and started systematically stripping their estate and assets. 

He used his visits to gain access to Ms Brown's security codes and also sold her Porsche and other cars.

When her parents died, he plundered their bank accounts - defrauding a total of more than £500,000 from them.

The couple died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland.

After they died building society staff eventually became suspicious that withdrawals were still being made in 2010 and police were called. 

They believed they were just investigating a fraud but it soon became apparent Ms Brown was missing and a murder inquiry was launched. 

He hadn't worked since an accident in 1997 when a JCB bucket hit him on the back and he was awarded £40,000 compensation. 

Graham was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for killing Ms Brown.

Northumbria Police subsequently launched an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act into his finances.

Graham stole more than £800,000 from Ms Brown to fund his love of supercars and a lavish lifestyle

The court heard with his fleet of flash sports cars and his large imposing house on a hill, pony-tailed and goatee-bearded Graham thought of himself as a charmer and cut a distinctive figure in his long leather coat.

He liked to play the big man, pretending to be related to murdered Viv Graham who was shot and killed in an unsolved apparent gangland hit in 1993, in an effort to enhance his reputation as a force to be reckoned with.

In fact he was a failed former policeman in the Met, having quit after a week in the 1970s, apparently homesick for his native North East.

The court heard Graham's main motivation in life was always money and he had a penchant for women over whom he could exert power and control.

-----------------------------------------------
West Bromwich Albion had just produced a typical Tony Pulis performance to beat his former club Crystal Palace 2-0 when he claimed he will never change.

The 57-year-old’s gritty, resilient playing style is well reflected in the touchline attire he insists on wearing at every game; cap, track suit and shiny white trainers.

James Morrison headed in within two minutes and Craig Gardner added a stunning 30-yard strike in the second half, but Alan Pardew’s side dominated the remainder of the game only to be met by West Brom’s stubborn doggedness.

All viewed by Pulis beneath the peak of that cap. ‘I’d never take my cap off during a game they’d have to put it in my contract,’ he explained. ‘I watched the first game for Albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because I’d had enough of sitting there. That’s just the way I am. I want to be close to the action.’ 

West Brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five.

Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit and tie on Saturday.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted last week that he started smartening up on the sideline after his chairman Daniel Levy told him to.

‘I’ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,’ Pulis added. ‘I’ve always done it and I don’t see no reason not to just because we’re in the Premier League with all the TV cameras and everything. I’ve done it right from my days at Bournemouth.’

 Why change a ritual that works? The three points moved West Brom to 36 points which virtually guarantees them safety. Much like he achieved at Palace last year. That’s worth doffing your cap to.

Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd has  rescued 35 crew members from a sinking ship.

The rescue mission comes after the Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker followed it's world record breaking pursuit of the accused poaching vessel Thunder for more than 100 days.

Bob Barker Captain Peter Hammarstedt said 35 crew members, who abandoned the sinking ship, were safely rescued  off the coast of Africa after being held in life rafts.

The toothfish poaching vessel Thunder issued a distressing signal, claiming that the ship was sinking at about 4.00pm on Monday.

Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd ship 'Bob Barker' has rescued 35 crew members from a sinking ship

'The Captain of Thunder radioed us and said their ship was sinking. We  launched our small boat and did everything we could to assist,' Mr Hammarstedt said.

'It appeared as though the ship and crew were in a serious situation.'

Mr Hammarstedt told ABC News they have been following the 'internationally-wanted poaching vessel for the past 110 days' as part of its Operation Icefish.

'Our suspicion is that the captain of the Thunder, knowing he's run out of fuel, has deliberately sunk his own boat in order to destroy any physical evidence,' he said.

'I've sent a couple of my crew onboard the Thunder — my chief engineer examined the engine room, which is completely underwater.

'We also notice they've opened several hatches — those that the water, once it's filled one area of the ship, will quickly go into another and it's clear, in my opinion, that this ship was sunk.'

The poaching vessel Thunder was trailed for more than 100 days before it started to submerged on Monday

Around 35 crew members from the Thunder ship were safely rescued after being held in life rafts 

Operation Icefish has been very successful in exposing the operations of the alleged poachers and making connections between them and fishing companies in Spain. 

The Thunder  lost its nets, its catch and its profits for the entire season during the pursuit as they face prosecution in whichever port it is forced to go to once short of fuel and supplies.

This was the longest pursuit of a poacher in maritime history, surpassing the 21-day pursuit of a Uruguayan poacher in 2003 by Australian Customs.

Former US president George H.W. Bush looked in good health on Friday as he accompanied Australian tennis player Roy Emerson at the  U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston, Texas.

Bush, 90, fell ill in December and was hospitalized after complaining of shortness of breath. Smiling and enjoying the fresh air, he seemed to be in better spirits.

Bush is a fan of Associated Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour 250 events and lives in the Houston Area with his wife Barbara.

He and his wife have attended many ATP fundraisers and charity events throughout the years.

In good spirits!: Former President George H.W. Bush, seated, arrives just before the quarterfinal match between Jeremy Chardy of France and Kevin Anderson from South Africa was suspended by rain

Roy Emerson, 78, who owns 28 major singles and doubles championships, is also a big fan and makes an annual appearance at the tournament.

Both Bush and Emerson enjoyed watching  Kevin Anderson of South Africa battle Jeremy Chardy of France before heavy rains postponed the game.

Bush looked in far better shape than he did late last year and three years prior when he was also hospitalized.

Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. 

He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital.

Bush is the oldest living former American president. Because he suffers from Parkinson's disease, he is forced to rely on a scooter or a wheelchair. 

In attendance: Roy Emerson, 78, who owns 28 major singles and doubles championships, is also a big fan and makes an annual appearance at the tournament

Raymond Handley , 62 , jailed for 13-and-a-half years for sexually assaulting girl , 8 . Daughter Becky , 20 , learned of his crimes after reading about them online . Described her father as ` disgusting ' and said he should be ` hanged ' Now wants to change her name via deed poll and disown him .
-----------------------------------------------
The daughter of a paedophile jailed for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl said her father should be hanged for his crimes. 

Becky Handley, 20, discovered her father, Raymond Handley's grisly crimes against a child in a local newspaper article. 

He was jailed for 13-and-a-half years at Birmingham Crown Court after details of the repeated assaults emerged. 

Now his daughter, who was kept from seeing him as a child, has disowned him and vowed to change her name via deed poll. 

Becky Handley said her father Raymond Handley should be 'hanged' for sexually assaulting a girl, eight. Miss Handley, a restaurant worker, learned of his crimes after reading about them online 

So disgusted with his crimes, Miss Handley said her father deserves the death penalty rather than a prison term. 

'I want the death penalty brought back for people like my father. I think he should be hanged for what he has done.' 

Speaking of the victim, who Miss Handley says she does not know, she added: 'I really feel bad for this young girl and I really hope that she gets through it. 

'He has stolen a little girl's innocence and I hope he rots in prison and dies there for what he has done.' 

Birmingham Crown Court heard how Handley, 62, sexually assaulted his young victim twice before threatening to kill her mother if details of the abuse emerged. 

Miss Handley now wants to change her name via deed poll 

It took the child years to report the incidents to police for fear of him. She is understood to have suffered severe psychological since. 

Miss Handley was not aware of her father's crimes until her sister showed her a local newspaper article which detailed the case.

'I just saw the name in the headline and I immediately thought "Oh God, he's dead!". 

'But when I read the headline properly, I just couldn't believe what I was seeing,' added the restaurant worker. 

'I felt deeply ashamed to have the Handley name. I want my father to die behind bars.' 

Miss Handley did not see her father as a child and was discouraged from contacting him by her mother as an adult.  

She has lived with her mother, Dawn Williams, and stepfather since she was nine. 

Speaking of her former husband, Ms Williams, 52, said: 'I always had a gut feeling about him. I found out that he was breaking into schools and houses and I kicked him out.' 

The pair divorced before Becky's first birthday. 

'He is a horrible man. He's a real rotten apple and I wish I'd known more about him before I started a relationship with him.

'What he has done is disgusting. I can't even think about what he has done to that poor girl.'  

Jailing Handley earlier this month, Judge Roderick Henderson, cited the paedophile's threats against his victim's family.  

'She was extremely young and can be described as suffering severe psychological harm from what you had done.' 

Handley denied his crimes, his lawyer saying that of his 90 previous convictions none had been of a sexual nature. 

Handley was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court (above) where a judge told of the 'severe psychological damage' the attacks inflicted on his victim

Ronen Ziv 's unborn baby is due this week in Kathmandu . `` It 's terrifying , '' he says .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)As Nepal grapples with an earthquake that has killed more than 3,400 people, Ronen Ziv worries about someone he has never met.

His unborn baby is due this week in Kathmandu. He had tickets to travel to Nepal for his child's birth from a surrogate mother, but now he has no choice but to wait in his native Israel for news.

"It's terrifying," Ziv said. "I can tell you I didn't get much sleep ...  all my thoughts and all my prayers are for the surrogate mother and the unborn child."

Nepal is a popular place for Israeli couples to have surrogate children. Ziv's first child, a 15-month-old daughter, was born to a surrogate mother in Nepal. Ziv and his partner, Tom, traveled to Nepal for the birth. They were planning on making the trip once again, but the earthquake forced them to change their plans.

Companies that help arrange surrogate pregnancies estimate 25 couples are now in Kathmandu with newborn surrogate children, while 10 to 15 surrogate mothers are due to give birth in the coming weeks.

The country is also a popular spot for Israeli travelers. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates there are about 600 to 700 Israelis in Nepal.

Israel Defense Forces is sending 260 emergency responders to Nepal, including search-and-rescue teams. The group is also bringing almost 100 tons of medical aid supplies.

Ziv says his baby is in a breech position, requiring a cesarean section. In the current chaos of Kathmandu, he worries his surrogate mother, Nafisa Shaje, will not get the proper medical attention required for a safe and healthy birth.

Ziv would prefer Shaje fly to Israel, where hospitals can provide the needed medical help. But with only days left until the baby is due, Ziv said putting Shaje on a plane might not be possible.

"If anything else happens, it could very quickly go to absolute catastrophe," Ziv says.

Hospitals in Nepal have been flooded with injured quake victims. Some have been turned away so doctors can tend to the most severely injured.

Cila Tamir, Ziv's attorney, has been working with the Ministry of the Interior to try to bring Shaje to Israel.

"She has no place to deliver. No conditions," Tamir said. "Everything is ruined there, and I'm sure that the hospital doesn't function normally because of the casualties and the injuries."

Robert Kennedy Jr. compared `` vaccine-induced '' autism to the Holocaust . David Perry : Kennedy has apologized for the wrong things . He says Kennedy seems to think people with autism are `` gone , '' their lives `` destroyed '' Perry : Autism is not a death sentence .
-----------------------------------------------
(CNN)Recently, Robert Kennedy Jr. was in Sacramento, California, to campaign against Senate Bill 227, which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations. In his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening, he decided to compare "vaccine-induced" autism to the Holocaust. He said, "They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone," Kennedy said. "This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country."

A few days later, he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the Holocaust. To many, it's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis.

In a statement, Kennedy said, "I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic. I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism, which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families."

Robert Kennedy Jr. has apologized for the wrong things.

First and foremost, vaccines do not cause autism. The two have nothing to do with each other.

Second, he seems to think people with autism are "gone," their lives "destroyed" and their families "shattered." Autism is not a death sentence. People with autism are not missing or destroyed. They are everywhere, trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman, missing or worthless.

Kennedy's rhetoric is a problem, even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines. People who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas. Others, believing autism functions as a death sentence, even kill their children.

I am worried about the effect of having such a powerful, high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism.

I reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment. Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, wrote, "Robert Kennedy Jr, who has engaged with autism only to spread lies, misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric, has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic Americans. While his father, uncle and many others in the Kennedy-Shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities, he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity."

These are harsh words, but try to see the situation through Ne'eman's eyes. Not only is Kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory, but he's also suggesting that it's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic.

The usual response to people like Ne'eman is that he is "high functioning," but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals?

Henry Frost, an autistic teenager and writer, is devastated by this focus on burden. Last year, he wrote a post to other autistic children: "Know you are not a burden or trouble for being. You are a person who has every right to be. A family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted. The family is wrong. Not You."

Meanwhile, Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist and blogger, wrote, "I am very disabled, have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions, seizures almost every day, but am happy, proud and accomplished, with the human supports I have. That's what is missing. Acceptance." As children, Sequenzia and Frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as "gone," by Kennedy. Clearly, both are very much present.

The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity. Michael S. Monje Jr., an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press, wrote, "The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude. It is a way for autistic people, as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology, to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural. The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural, less worthy, or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world."

I wish Kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities, even as he defended the sacred status of the Holocaust.

There is, though, one story from the Holocaust that he might do well to consider. The first group the Nazis systematically exterminated, in the infamous Action T4, were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities.  Thousands of children, adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers, laying the groundwork for the later, larger scale acts of genocide. Underlying Action T4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value.

We fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity, not by fearmongering.

Kennedy owes a lot of people another apology.

Bournemouth were promoted to the Premier League on Monday . The Cherries official name is AFC Bournemouth . The Gunners will start the season in second place for the first time in 100 years .
-----------------------------------------------
For the first time since in 100 years, Arsenal will not start the season at the summit of England's top-flight, following the effective promotion of Bournemouth on Monday.

The Cherries official name is AFC Bournemouth, meaning their name would start ahead of Arsenal's by virtue of the alphabet when the embryonic table is compiled upon the announcement of next season's fixtures.

The Goldsands Stadium, home of AFC Bournemouth, will host Premier League football next season

Bournemouth's promotion means Arsenal will start season in second place for the first time in 100 years

Arsenal have theoretically started each season since 1915/16 at the summit of England's top tier, although the advent of the First World War meant it was only in 1919 that the club officially began their century-old record.

The Gunners only finished fifth in the last pre-war competitive season, but they were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division after the First World War in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham.

After Eddie Howe guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land on Monday with victory over Bolton, only a highly improbable goal-swing would deny them automatic promotion.

As a result, Arsenal will begin next season second in the Premier League before a ball is kicked, behind the south coast club by a full 12 letters.

Eddie Howe has remarkably guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land

Newcastle United have dumped pictures of Sir Bobby Robson 's title-chasing side in a skip outside St James ' Park .

-----------------------------------------------
Newcastle United have upset supporters after dumping pictures of Sir Bobby Robson’s title-chasing team in a skip outside St James’ Park.

Framed squad photographs of Sir Bobby alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Gary Speed, Nobby Solano and Shay Given have been found discarded alongside grass cuttings, cardboard boxes and bin bags.

The pictures were removed from corporate boxes inside the stadium and have been replaced by more recent images.

Framed photographs of Sir Bobby Robson's title-chasing side were found thrown in a skip outside the stadium

The skip was situated outside St James' Park where fans were able to spot the disgraceful move by the club

Steve Wraith, of NUFC Fans United, told the Chronicle: ‘They could have auctioned them for charity, but just to put these things in the bin is awful. Now fans are talking about going and helping themselves.

‘They are pictures of club legends. I don’t think the club want people to be reminded of a time when they were doing well because they are doing so badly at the moment.’

Robson’s team finished fourth in 2002 and qualified for the Champions League, where they memorably made it to the second group phase after a last-gasp victory in Feyenoord.

Alan Shearer, Gary Speed and Nolberto Solano are some of the legends who are included in the photos

Sir Bobby, who passed away in 2009, is still fondly remembered and has a statue outside of the stadium

In 2003 they topped the table for a period before finishing third, a return which has not been bettered in the years since.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the club said the images were ‘old and not being used anymore’.

But the ‘AshleyOut.com’ group, who are behind Sunday’s planned boycott of Newcastle’s home match with Spurs, tweeted: ‘Our proud history in the skip outside SJP along with ambition and hope’.

Newcastle fan David Crosier tweeted: 'As a metaphor for the club this could not be more apt. Classless. There is nothing left to support at NUFC under this regime'. 

Former club captain Shearer (left) flourished under Sir Bobby and was instrumental in qualifying for Europe

Gary Speed (right), who died in 2011, was another player who loved playing for his former manager

Nolberto Solano (right) was a key figure in Newcastle's title challenge and is also seen as a club legend

Newcastle, who lost to Liverpool on Monday, have never been the same since Sir Bobby left the club

John Carver worked under Robson during his time in charge and should no doubt be upset by this move

Theo Walcott has made just five starts for Arsenal this season . The winger 's contract is set to run out next summer . Arsenal are interested in Liverpool 's Raheem Sterling . Gunners legend Ian Wright would be ` sad ' to see Walcott leave .
-----------------------------------------------
Arsenal legend Ian Wright would be disappointed to see Theo Walcott leave north London, and believes his troubled times at the club are down to Arsene Wenger's refusal to play him as a striker.

Walcott has made just five starts for Arsenal this season since returning from a serious knee injury after seven months on the sidelines.

And with Arsenal pursuing Raheem Sterling and Walcott's contract set to run out next summer, Wright is worried that the Gunners could stand to lose a valuable player. 

Theo Walcott could be on the way out of Arsenal, and Gunners legend Ian Wright says that would be 'a shame'

Wright enjoys Walcott as a player and hinted that he would like to see the winger stay at the club

Walcott started up front for England against Italy on Tuesday but his appearances have been limited this year

'It's a shame for him, and the fact that people are talking about him maybe moving on if someone else comes in makes me quite sad,' he said.

'I really like him at Arsenal but he's got massive decisions to make in the next few months.'

Wright also believes the England wideman, who was played in a central role for his country in Italy on Tuesday night, should have been moved into a similar position for his Arsenal.

Walcott's pace had seen him likened to the Gunners' record goalscorer Thierry Henry, who made a similar positional switch during his time in north London, but manager Wenger has only briefly experimented with Walcott as a striker. 

Thierry Henry was prolific as a striker for Arsenal after being moved inside from his familiar wide role

Arsene Wenger has only briefly used Walcott up front, and Wright says it should have been persisted with

Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is an Arsenal target who also has his contract expiring in the near future

'I always believed Theo should have been a striker at Arsenal with his pace. I thought playing him on the right would last so long and then he would get moved inside,' Wright told Goal. I'm not saying he's the same kind of player as Thierry Henry by any stretch, but I thought Arsene would move him inside.

'I think that's been to his detriment, because he would have learned a lot more about the game and runs he'd have to make. I've seen him finish very well when he gets into one-on-one situations.'

The kidnapper who claims to have masterminded the Gone Girl kidnapping of Denise Huskins in California says he will turn himself in, but only if his co-conspirators are given immunity.

In yet another email to the San Francisco Chronicle, the individuals wrote that police could accept this offer, or that he would 'go overseas and teach English' or 'live off the grid and read books for the rest of my life.'

This came just one day after the group demanded an apology from the police for calling the entire incident a hoax.

Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents' home.

After her 'release' police accused them of staging the kidnapping – a claim they both strongly denied.  

Scroll down for videos

The self-proclaimed kidnapper behind the Gone Girl abduction of Denise Huskins (second from right with her mother and two brothers) says he will turn himself in

This is the Vallejo Police Department and spokesman Lt. Kenny Park (above) grand his co-conspirators immunity from prosecution

This comes one day after the kidnappers claimed they monitored Huskins' boyfriend Aaron Quinn (above) after the kidnapping so he would not go to police, which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours

In the email from earlier in the week, the kidnappers write; 'I/we may be the direct agent of harm. But it will be made crystal clear that the Vallejo Police Department, and you, Mr. [Kenny] Park, had every opportunity to stop it.'

Last week Lt. Park, the spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, said that the kidnapping of Huskins, which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers, 40 detectives and numerous FBI agents, was  an 'orchestrated event.'

The letter to the Chronicle says authorities had until noon on Tuesday to apologize.

That time came and went however, and this new email arrived Tuesday afternoon. 

The old email had demanded that the police make clear that neither Huskins or her boyfriend Aaron Quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges.

As for the main reason behind the kidnapping, they write; 'The Mare Island kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets.' 

They then compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11, the famous caper film that starred members of the Rat Pack when it premiered in 1960 and Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney in the 2001 remake.

It is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either, also reaching out to them on March 24 with an audio file of Huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in Mare Island.

She  eventually turned up in Huntington Beach, where both of her parents live, just a few hours later.

This latest email, sent on Saturday from a dummy account, was 9,000 words long, and detailed why the group kidnapped Huskins, and how they went about taking her from her home.

The group consists of three members, two with college educations, and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area.

They claim they drilled holes in the window of Huskins and Quinn's home to gain entry, and then used squirt guns with 'strobe flashlights and laser pointers' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms.

They say they played 'calming music' as they went about the abduction, and put monitors on Quinn, 30, so they could make sure he did not go to police.

They then say they put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's car and drove off with her.

The group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of Huskins and Quinn's home (above) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take Huskins

The kidnapping, which has been called an 'orchestrated event' by authorities, has drawn comparisons to the film Gone Girl (above)

In the end however, they claim it was a case of mistaken identity, and they did not mean to take Huskins, thinking that someone else would be in the house.

They say that is why they decided to drop her off in Huntington Beach and that they were 'horrified at what we had done.'

As for the ransom they requested, what police believe to be a rather paltry $8,500, the group said: 'We chose $8,500 because it was below the $10,000 reporting threshold, and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law.'

Attorneys for both Quinn and Huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email, and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth.

Huskins' attorney, Doug Rappaport, said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used 'sophisticated computer skills' that neither they or the FBI could 'comprehend.'

Lt. Park, the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI all have yet to comment on the emails.

Reportedly, such an odd feature may prove to be especially beneficial to those on a business trip, as aquariums are believed to reduce anxiety and lower blood pressure.

Unsurprisingly then, the hotel will also place a fish in on-site meeting rooms and banquet halls.

The man's grandmother said the fire was lit after the suspects attempted to carjack her grandson, ABC 7 reported. 

She said: 'He said he was pumping gas and some guys came up and asked for the car.

'They pulled out a gun and he took off running. 

'They took the [gas] tank and started spraying.'

The Los Angeles County Fire Department is investigating the incident as an arson and the suspects remain at large.

Surveillance video of the incident is being used in the investigation.

Gloating as he relaxes with his AK-47, these pictures show an al-Qaeda commander relaxing inside a palace in Yemen just days after terrorists liberated him from prison.

Khalid Saeed Batarfi was a senior leader with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) before he was jailed by Yemeni officials.

Two days ago he was freed, along with 300 other inmates, as the terrorist group stormed the prison he was being held in, killing two guards.

Batarfi is among AQAP's top regional commanders, known for his leading role in a 2011-2012 battle with government troops during which extremists seized large parts of the south and east of Yemen.

Pictures posted online today show the high-ranking terrorist grinning as he sits in the governor's palace in the city of Mukalla, pretending to be on the telephone as he wields an assault rifle.

A second photograph shows Batarfi standing on a Yemeni flag in the abandoned building.

The militants stormed the Central Prison of Mukalla with machine guns and rocket launchers during a midnight raid on Thursday.

Rebels: Yemen's president fled to Saudi Arabia after Houthi rebels launched an attack on his palace in the capital Sana'a 

After taking over the prison and freeing a number of members of AQAP, the terrorists overran government buildings and the city's port.

According to CBS, AQAP Twitter accounts tweeted after the prison raid: 'All the brothers have been liberated, including Sheikh Batarfi who is now amongst his brothers, all praise to Allah.'

Mukalla was previously under control of forces loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, however it is not clear what resistance to the terrorists remains after he fled the capital Sana'a to Saudi Arabia as rebels launched an attack on his palace.

-----------------------------------------------
The Football Association will be contacting QPR and Chelsea after an incident which saw Branislav Ivanovic struck on the head by a cigarette lighter thrown from a section of home supporters at Loftus Road.

QPR are unlikely to face disciplinary action over the incident which happened as Chelsea players celebrated the winning goal in Sunday's 1-0 victory.

It is understood however that the FA will seek observations from each club and will ensure that QPR and the police are taking the necessary steps to identify the culprit via CCTV and for them to face a banning order.

QPR are reviewing CCTV footage and have promised to ban those involved. They have also appealed to witnesses to come forward.

A club spokesperson said: 'Whilst we understand that passions run high during derby fixtures, this is not the kind of behaviour the club condones in any way, shape or form.

'We take a zero tolerance approach to this sort of behaviour and, if the perpetrators are identified, they will be banned indefinitely from the stadium and, where appropriate, we will liaise with the Metropolitan Police.

'The club are awaiting communication from the FA following the referee's report and will work closely with them in ensuring something like this does not happen again.

'We would also appeal to fans with any information regarding yesterday's incident to contact the club, as we feel it's important to identify the perpetrators as soon as possible, as we believe they are not a true representation of the QPR fan-base.'

-----------------------------------------------
Everton's Steven Pienaar has admitted he considered retirement as frustration took its toll during his injury-ravaged season.

The influential 33-year-old midfielder Pienaar has been dogged by groin and knee injuries this season limiting him to just 11 appearances. 

He returned to action from his latest setback in the 1-1 draw with Swansea City earlier this month but muscle fatigue ruled him out of the win over Burnley last weekend.

Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar is held back by Swansea's Ki Sung-Yueng at the Liberty Stadium 

Pienaar said: 'At one stage, I thought I had better just hang my boots up and call it a day but on the other side I was just thinking that I enjoy going in and seeing the guys so I just had to stay strong and that kept me going.

'When you are at home not coming in for training you feel very down but as soon as I walk through the door, there’s always the camaraderie in the group, there is always fun.

'Even if you are injured, you can always laugh and it keeps you going. Just to be among the players, it’s kept me going.' 

Pienaar has made just 11 appearances for the Toffees this season due to groin and knee injuries

Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night.

The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work.

But when the imam arrived, the killer got into the rear seat of his Volkswagen Passat and shot him several times.

The murder at 11.15am on Tuesday bears all the hallmarks of a professional assassination because the gunman was thought to have used a silencer and it took place away from CCTV cameras.

Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers are investigating whether Mr Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, was murdered on the orders of the regime.

They suspect the part-time builder was tricked into driving to Wembley to quote for a job – but the killer was put off when the imam took his teenage son along and claimed he could not find the keys to the house.

He is thought to have been executed when the mystery client – described as having an African accent – asked Mr Arwani to return a second time alone.

Shortly after the shooting Mr Arwani's car was discovered 'perfectly parked' on the side of the road with the engine still running and with one of the windows wound down.

The father-of-six from Acton, west London, had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Syria and other countries in the Middle East.

He is understood to have been a member of the organisation until about seven years ago, but retained ties to some of the group's senior figures.

The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. Above, two men stand outside the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, which is near to where Mr Arwani was shot dead on Tuesday

Police cordoned off the murder scene. It is thought that when the imam arrived, the killer got into his Volkswagen Passat

Mr Arwani was a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who is pictured above in September 2013

Mr Arwani fled Syria in 1982 after a massacre in his home city of Hama carried out on the orders of Assad's father, Hafez.

The imam, who moved to Britain in the mid-1990s after studying Islamic law in Jordan, claimed he was sentenced to death in his absence by the Syrian regime.

He was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London three years ago.

Police were forced to use riot shields to beat back protesters after they broke through barriers, and six people were arrested.

Mr Arwani told reporters during the demonstration: 'This building belongs to the Syrian people, not a regime killing people every single day for ten months.'

Detectives are also considering whether the father of six was killed by someone associated with the notorious An Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam from 2005 to 2011.

Leighton Baines is well known for his love of music but it appears his appreciation does not extend to all genres - specifically the latest pop songs dominating the charts.

The Everton defender, who is friends with rocker Miles Kane and Arctic Monkeys' front-man Alex Turner, regularly attends gigs and also plays the guitar.

But in an interview with Match of the Day magazine, the England international has given his thoughts on six mainstream tracks which don't feature on his own iPod.

As well as admitting that he doesn't know any of One Direction's hit songs, Baines also reveals that Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk is regularly played in the Toffees' dressing room.

Scroll down to read Baines' full verdict on the music world, including his views on Ed Sheeran, Meghan Trainor and Avicii. 

Meghan Trainor – All About The Bass

'This is the kind of track we play in the dressing room, but it's not my cup of tea really! The lads keep me away from the stereo because they don't enjoy any of the stuff I put on.'

Mark Ronson (featuring Bruno Mars) – Uptown Funk

'The lads are all playing this one! It's quite a cool tune for a pop song. It's good, Mark Ronson's always trying to do interesting stuff.'

The interview with Leighton Baines features in the latest edition of Match of the Day magazine, on sale between April 21 and 27.

Avicii – The Nights

'This sounds like something my 11-year-old lad might listen to! He's getting to the point where he knows his own mind so I'm not going to force my favourite music on him.'

Ed Sheeran – Thinking Out Loud

'Ed Sheeran's massive, he's not someone I've got into yet, but he's obviously doing well enough for himself. I think a lot of kids like him.'

George Ezra – Budapest

'This is a good song. I haven't heard much of George Ezra's stuff, this is all stuff my kids play around the house so I recognise it.'

One Direction – Night Changes

'I have to admit, I don't really know any of their songs! But it all makes sense, this is the sort of thing the kids are into, I just don't listen to any of it.'

Ed Sheeran is 'massive' according to Baines, but the Everton man is yet to start listening to his music

Baines admits that he doesn't know any of One Direction's songs despite their global success

It may look absurd, but a bizarre new dog grooming trend is beginning to take shape in Taiwan.

The craze involves having your pet pooch shaped into a sphere or a square - with the desired effect being a more eye-grabbing and clean-cut look.

In a method reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands's trimming of a hedge, canine hairdressers in the Taiwanese capital Taipei are giving particularly furry customers outlandish makeovers.

What a square! A dog shows off Taiwan's bizarre new pet-grooming trend after having his fur cut in a square

Hairdresser Tain Yeh, 42, who runs a parlour in Taipei said: 'I am aware of the trend although we don't have much request for it here because it's very difficult to keep the shape. 

'It came about because people were always looking for more impressive haircuts, and somebody came up with the idea of shaping the dog like a hedge.'

Pictures of doe-eyed dogs with their shapely new cuts have proved extremely popular online prompting more owners to seek out the custom salons.

Many are now opting for the cuts simply to get more likes and shares on social media sites.

Ms Yeh added: 'The dogs don't mind, and the owners keep coming back for more. This sort of haircut needs a lot more maintenance then the regular type.

'It is also not suitable for all breeds. The dog needs to have plenty of hair to play around with so that you can shape it around the face and body.'
